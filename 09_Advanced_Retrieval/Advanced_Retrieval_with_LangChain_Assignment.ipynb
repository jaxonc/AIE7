Additionally, financial hardships, stagnant wages, or underemployment can make it impossible for borrowers to keep up with payments, especially when repayment options are limited or not properly communicated.

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",
