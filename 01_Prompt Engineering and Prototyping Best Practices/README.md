### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE7 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE7/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Expected Answer: High level overview of OOP concepts that would be easy to understand and relatable to non programming concepts.
    - Aspect Tested: 
        Concept decomposition and audience tailoring
            Translation of complex concepts to easily understandable explanations. 
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Expected Answer: Few sentences detailing comprehensive overview of the Pokemon GO Terms of Service
    - Aspect Tested: 
        Summarization and condensing 
            Ability to accurately generate TLDR summaries of dense text
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Expected Answer: Story that makes sense and adheres to the text limit and content description.
    - Aspect Tested: 
        "Creativity" and constraint acknowldegment
            Ability to generate content that follows the expected conventions of a concept such as imaginative storytelling while also limiting the output to fit provided text constraints.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Expected Answer:
    - Aspect Tested: 
        Logical Reasoning 
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Expected Answer:
    - Aspect Tested:

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, push the changes to your HF Space and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
1. Ambiguity
    - Though "vibe checking" can be useful for identifying gaps in a LLM-powered systems perfromance, the ambiguious nature of the prompts given can lead to over/under validating the "vibe" depending on the use case. 
2. Improvement directionality
    - Without clear performance metrics, it may be difficult to acertain useful methods to consider when addressing an LLM-powered system that was determined to give "bad vibes".
3. Robustness
    - Again while a useful initial check, given the non-comprehensive nature of "vibe checking" there are no guarantees your system will not fail at crucial functions provided a successful "vibe check".
