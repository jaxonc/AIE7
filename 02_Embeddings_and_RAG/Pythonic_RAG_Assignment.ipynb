            "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to a situation where leaders, particularly CEOs or startup founders, hire executives who are weak in their respective functions. This often occurs because the leader has difficulty letting go of the area of expertise that initially contributed to their success, leading them to bring in weaker individuals for key executive roles to maintain their own authority in those domains. The context highlights this issue by referencing Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who encountered challenges with ABC after buying it, indicating that sometimes leaders overestimate their ability to manage certain functions and inadvertently create a weaker executive team. This problem emphasizes the importance of hiring strong executives rather than those who may allow the original leader to remain dominant in their field (Source 1).\n",

            "\n",
            "2. **Buffer for Surprises**: The definition of “at least enough money” should include a significant buffer beyond your initial financial plan. This acts as insurance against unexpected challenges, particularly important for startups that have not yet achieved Product/Market Fit, as the timeline to reach it can be uncertain (Source 1).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Progress Demonstration**: If you cannot raise a sufficient amount of money in one go, focus on raising as much as possible in each round, with the goal of demonstrating progress towards Product/Market Fit in subsequent funding rounds (Source 2).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Historical Context**: Reflect on examples from past successful startups. Many successful companies raised significant funding when available, which positioned them for success in later stages. Essentially, there seems to be a correlation between raising adequate funds early and the sustainability of the startup (Source 3).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Control and Rationality**: While raising funds, be mindful not to give away control of your company and ensure that the amount you seek is reasonable and not excessive (Source 3).\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, strategize funding based on your current developmental stage, maintain a buffer for unforeseen challenges, and learn from historical examples while keeping control and reasonableness in mind.\n"
