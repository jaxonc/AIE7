    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

      "The best way to write a loop in Python depends on your specific use case. However, there are general principles and techniques that can help you write clear and efficient loops. Here are a few of them:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Use `for` loops for Iterating Over Sequences\n",
      "Python's `for` loop is excellent for iterating over items in a sequence (like lists, tuples, or strings).\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a for loop\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Use `while` Loops for Conditional Iteration\n",
      "Use a `while` loop when you want to continue iterating until a condition is met.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of a while loop\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Be Mindful of Loop Performance\n",
      "When dealing with large datasets, consider whether you can use built-in functions or comprehensions for better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# List comprehension as a concise way to create lists\n",
      "squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "print(squared)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Avoid Modifying the List During Iteration\n",
      "If you need to modify a list while iterating over it, it's safer to create a copy or use a different approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using a copy of the list to avoid modification errors\n",
      "original_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
      "for item in original_list[:]:  # Iterate over a shallow copy\n",
      "    if item % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        original_list.remove(item)\n",
      "print(original_list)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Use `break` and `continue` Judiciously\n",
      "You can use `break` to exit a loop early and `continue` to skip to the next iteration. Use these sparingly to maintain code readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example using break and continue\n",
      "for num in range(10):\n",
      "    if num == 5:\n",
      "        break  # Exit the loop when num is 5\n",
      "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        continue  # Skip even numbers\n",
      "    print(num)  # This will print only odd numbers less than 5\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Keep Code Readable\n",
      "Using meaningful variable names and keeping the loop body concise helps maintain readability. Comments can also be helpful when the logic is complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, you can write effective and clear loops suited to your particular needs. Feel free to ask if you have any specific scenarios or questions in mind!\n"

      "Response: The 'Michael Eisner Memorial Weak Executive Problem' refers to the tendency of a CEO or startup founder to hire a weak executive for a function they are familiar with, in order to maintain control over that area. The problem is illustrated through the example of Michael Eisner, who, despite being a successful TV network executive, acquired ABC and let it fall to fourth place. Eisner's response to the decline was to claim that if he had more time, he could fix the problem himself. This reflects a common issue where leaders are reluctant to let go of their area of expertise, leading them to select someone underqualified for the role. The context emphasizes the importance of hiring strong executives in areas that are critical for the organization's success, rather than opting for weaker candidates to avoid feeling overshadowed.\n",

      "Based on the provided context, when approaching the hiring of a CEO for your startup, you should consider the following key points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Assess Founding Team Capability**: If you do not have someone on your founding team who is capable of being CEO, the advice is to sell your company immediately. This emphasizes the importance of having internal talent beforehand to lead the startup (Source 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Beware of Executive Background**: Be cautious about hiring an executive from a large successful company for your startup. The skill sets required in a big company differ significantly from those needed in a startup environment. Many executives from large corporations may struggle to adapt to a startup’s unique challenges, particularly if they come from firms with substantial market dominance (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Timing of Hiring**: Make sure that you truly need an executive, and avoid hiring one too early in the startup’s lifecycle. Before achieving product/market fit, it is often better to have a motivated manager or director rather than an expensive executive who may not contribute effectively at that stage (Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ideal Candidate Characteristics**: Your ideal CEO should be someone who can succeed independently, meaning they should be able to operate effectively without micromanagement and handle the demanding and intense responsibilities inherent in a startup role (Source 2 and Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "By incorporating these insights, you can make a more informed decision about hiring a CEO for your startup.\n",
