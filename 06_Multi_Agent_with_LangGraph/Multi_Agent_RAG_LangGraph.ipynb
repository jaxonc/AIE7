A school may have different academic years for different\\nacademic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently\\nfrom a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as\\nin the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in\\nweeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the\\nschool9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter).\\nA school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and\\ndefine different academic years for each version. If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different\\nacademic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which\\nprogram the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a\\nprogram, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different\\nacademic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students\\nenrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes.\\nWeeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year\\nFor both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum\\nnumber of weeks of instructional time.\\nFor a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time.\\nFor a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time.\\nNote: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which\\ndo not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours.\\nThe number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the\\nacademic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later.\\nSchools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want\\nto request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is\\npermitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled\\non a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing\\nof contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center.\\nFor all Title IV programs, a week of instructional time is any period of seven consecutive days in which 3\\nAt least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the last scheduled day of classes\\nRegulatory Citations\\nAcademic year minimums: 34 CFR 668.3(a)\\nWeeks of instructional time: 34 CFR 668.3(b)'),\n",

For example, a school might define the academic\\nyear for a program as containing 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time but have an academic calendar\\nconsisting of four 8-week nonstandard terms (i.e., 32 weeks of instructional time).

Academic\\nprogress in a non-term program can be measured in either credit or clock hours. In some cases (as discussed below), a\\nprogram with terms must be treated as a non-term program for Title IV purposes.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar is used only by subscription-based programs. A subscription-based program\\nis a term-based program in which the school charges a student for each term on a subscription basis with the expectation\\nthat the student will complete a specified number of credit hours (or the equivalent) during that term. However, classes in\\na subscription-based program are not required to begin or end within a specific timeframe in each term, as is the case in a\\nterm-based calendar that is not subscription-based. For more detail on subscription-based programs, see Volume 2,\\nChapter 2.\\nA subscription-based academic calendar consists of \"subscription periods\" that are either standard terms or substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms (for guidance on when terms are considered to be substantially equal in length, see <Payment\\nperiods for programs using standard terms or substantially equal nonstandard terms= later in this chapter). Substantially\\nequal nonstandard terms may be of any length, but if they are not at least nine weeks in length, the program must use\\nBBAY 3 for purposes of monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit progression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6 for more\\ninformation on BBAY 3). Nonstandard terms that are not substantially equal in length are not permissible in a\\nsubscription-based academic calendar.\\nThe term \"subscription period\" is synonymous with \"term\" and \"payment period\" (payment periods are covered later in\\nthis chapter). Except for the fact that classes are not required to start and end within a term, the rules and requirements\\nfor term-based programs that are not subscription-based also apply to subscription-based programs. These requirements\\ninclude:\\nminimum and maximum term length restrictions for standard terms (see the discussion in the next section of this\\nchapter);\\nrequirements for determining full-time enrollment (see Volume 1, Chapter 1);\\nuse of a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY), BBAY 1, BBAY 2, or BBAY 3 for monitoring Direct Loan annual loan limit\\nprogression (see Volume 8, Chapter 6); and\\nuse of Pell Grant formulas 1, 2, or 3 to calculate Pell Grant awards (see Volume 7, Chapter 4).\\nWhether an academic calendar is standard term, nonstandard term, non-term, or subscription-based has implications for\\nhow aid is awarded and disbursed under the Title IV programs.\\nStandard Terms: Semesters, Trimesters, and Quarters\\nSemesters and trimesters contain between 14 and 21 weeks of instructional time. However, a summer term in a program\\nusing semesters or trimesters may contain fewer than 14 weeks.

As with programs using semesters or trimesters, a\\nsummer term in a quarter-based program may contain fewer than nine weeks. An academic calendar using quarters\\ntypically includes four terms in the fall, winter, spring, and summer, three of which comprise an academic year. For\\nexample, the fall, winter, and spring quarters would comprise an academic year in a program using an SAY calendar. In a\\nprogram using a BBAY calendar, an academic year could be any three consecutive terms, such as spring-summer-fall, or\\nsummer-fall-winter. Academic progress is measured in quarter credit hours, and full time is at least 12 quarter credits.\\nSemesters may contain as few as 14 weeks and quarters may contain as few as nine weeks. Therefore, a school that\\ndefines the academic year for a program as 24 semester hours or 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time\\ncould have fall and spring semesters of 14 weeks each, resulting in 28 weeks of instruction, or fall, winter, and spring\\nquarters of nine weeks each, resulting in 27 weeks of instructional time. However, because the academic year for a\\nprogram that measures academic progress in credit hours must include a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time, a\\nschool with such an academic calendar would be required to calculate Pell Grant awards using either Pell Grant Formula 2\\nor Pell Grant Formula 3 (see Volume 7, Chapter 4).\\nFor Direct Loan purposes, two 14-week semesters or three 9-week quarters could not constitute an SAY or BBAY, since the\\nnumber of weeks of instructional time in an SAY or BBAY must generally meet the minimum 30-week statutory\\nrequirement (see Volume 8, Chapter 6). For its fall and spring semesters or fall, winter, and spring quarters to comprise an\\nSAY or BBAY, the school would need to modify its calendar to ensure that there are at least 30 weeks of instruction in the\\nfall and spring semesters or fall, winter, and spring quarters combined. For example, the school could have a 16-week fall\\nsemester and a 14-week spring semester. Another option would be for the school to extend the SAY or BBAY to include an\\nadditional term so that the total number of weeks of instructional time meets the 30-week minimum. For instance, the\\nschool could have an SAY consisting of 14-week fall and spring semesters and a 10-week summer term, or a BBAY\\nconsisting of any four consecutive 9-week quarters.\\nStandard terms need not be of equal length. For example, a school could offer a program using semesters with the\\nacademic year consisting of a 14-week fall semester and a 20-week spring semester, or a program using quarters with the\\nacademic year consisting of a 13-week fall quarter, a 9-week winter quarter, and an 11-week spring quarter.\\nIn addition, the number of weeks in a standard term may vary from year to year over the course of a program. For\\nexample, a school could offer a two-year program with the first academic year consisting of two 15-week semesters, and\\nthe second academic year consisting of two 20-week semesters.\\nIn a standard term academic calendar, a term may contain an occasional class or classes that are longer than the normal\\nterm or that begin or end beyond the normal start or end date of the term, as long as the class or classes do not overlap\\nanother term (see below). However, if classes routinely extend a week or more beyond the normal term start or end\\ndates, the school must revise the official length of the term.\\nGenerally, if the combined length of a term and an extended class or classes is greater than the maximum number of\\nweeks allowed for a standard term, the program must be considered a nonstandard term program for Title IV program\\npurposes. For example, if a 17-week semester contains a class that does not end until five weeks after the normal\\nsemester end date, the term must be considered nonstandard, because the combined length of the term and the\\nextended class is 22 weeks, which exceeds the maximum 21 weeks permitted for a semester.\\nThere is an exception to this general rule for standard quarters that are 12 weeks in length. A 12-week quarter may still\\nbe considered a standard term if it contains a class or classes that begin not more than two weeks before the official\\nbeginning date of the term or that end not more than two weeks after the official ending date of the term (for a total\\nperiod not to exceed two weeks). For example, a 12-week quarter containing a class that extends two weeks beyond the\\nnormal term ending date may still be considered a standard term, even though the combined length of the term and the\\nextended class (14 weeks) exceeds the maximum 13 weeks allowed for a quarter.\\nThe limited exception for 12-week quarters preserves a flexibility that was allowed under the policy on standard term\\nlength that was in effect prior to the implementation of the changes described in the November 5, 2019 Electronic\\nAnnouncement. Under prior policy a quarter could not exceed 12 weeks, but a quarter with a class or classes that'),\n",

For example, a 5-week term or a\\n23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or\\ngreater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different\\nlengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to\\nbe offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program.\\nEven if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do\\nnot comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week\\nquarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter\\nmust include a minimum of nine weeks.\\nSemesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in\\nthe manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but\\nmeasures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.\\nNon-Term Characteristics\\nA program that measures progress in clock hours is always treated as a non-term program.\\nExcept for subscription-based programs, a program that measures progress in credit-hours is considered to have a non-\\nterm calendar if it has:\\nCourses that do not begin and end within a set period of time such as a term;\\nCourses that overlap terms;\\nSelf-paced and independent study courses that overlap terms; or\\nSequential courses that do not begin and end within a term.\\nPayment Periods\\nThe payment period is applicable to all Title IV programs except the Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program.

For the Direct Loan Program only, this\\nsame requirement applies to students who are enrolled in programs with nonstandard terms that are not substantially\\nequal in length.\\nEffect of Accelerated Progression on Disbursement Timing in a Clock-Hour or Non-Term Credit-Hour Program\\nThe Pell Grant or TEACH Grant amount that a student is eligible to receive for a payment period in a clock-hour or non-\\nterm credit-hour program is based on the number of hours and weeks in the scheduled payment periods for the program\\nthat are established at the beginning of the program based on the program length (as described earlier in this chapter).\\nThese scheduled payment periods do not change, regardless of a student9s rate of progression through a clock-hour or\\nnon-term credit-hour program. This means that if a student completes additional weeks of instructional time or hours\\nwhile completing the other measure of a payment period, the actual number of weeks or hours that the student\\ncompletes before a disbursement can be made for the next payment period may differ from the number of weeks or hours\\nin the scheduled payment period used to determine the student9s grant amount for the payment period.\\nAlthough a student9s completion of additional weeks or hours in a payment period has no effect on the scheduled\\npayment periods for purposes of determining Pell Grant and TEACH Grant payment amounts, an undergraduate student\\nwho accelerates in a clock-hour or non-term credit-hour program may have reduced Direct Loan eligibility in the final\\nacademic year of a program. Specifically, if a student enrolled in a program that is greater than one academic year in\\nlength completes additional clock or credit hours prior to the final academic year of the program, this may result in a final\\nperiod of study that contains fewer clock or credit hours than the number of hours in the program9s defined academic\\nyear. In this circumstance, the Direct Loan annual loan limit for an undergraduate student must be prorated (reduced).\\nThe principles described above are illustrated by the examples in Appendix A at the end of this chapter. For guidance on\\ncalculating Pell Grant and TEACH Grant awards for clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, see Volume 7. For\\ninformation on Direct Loan annual loan limit proration and annual loan limit progression in clock-hour and non-term credit-\\nhour programs, see Volume 8, Chapters 5 and 6.\\nIf your school is unable to determine when a student has successfully completed half of the credit or clock hours in a\\nprogram, academic year, or remainder of a program, the student is considered to have begun the second payment period\\nof the program, academic year, or remainder of a program at the later of the date (identified by your school) that the\\nstudent has successfully completed:\\nhalf of the academic coursework in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program; or\\nhalf of the number of weeks of instructional time in the program, academic year, or remainder of the program.\\nDisbursement Timing in Subscription-Based Programs\\nFor the first two subscription periods (terms) that a student attends in a subscription-based program, there is no\\nrequirement for the student to have completed a certain amount of coursework before receiving a disbursement of Title IV\\nfunds (the same as in any other term-based program using credit hours). However, to receive a disbursement of Title IV\\naid for each subsequent subscription period in the program, the student must have completed a cumulative number of\\ncredit hours equal to the total of the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in all previously attended\\nsubscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was enrolled in the most\\nrecently attended subscription period. For more detailed guidance on the disbursement rules for subscription-based\\nprograms, including examples, refer to Appendix B at the end of this chapter.\\nMultiple Disbursements Within a Payment Period\\nThe regulations governing the Title IV programs generally permit schools to pay Title IV funds at such times and in such\\ninstallments within each payment period as will best meet students9 needs. This gives schools the ability to apportion the\\npayment if doing so will be in the best interest of the student. For example, if a payment period is particularly long, a\\nschool might choose to pay in multiple installments to the extent program requirements permit to ensure that a student\\nwill have funds to pay rent later in the payment period. If a school chooses to schedule multiple Direct Loan\\ndisbursements within a single payment period, the disbursements must be substantially equal. Note also that if the loan\\nperiod for a Direct Loan is a single payment period, the loan must be disbursed in at least two installments unless the\\nschool qualifies for an exception to the multiple disbursement requirement. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for more'),\n",

However, to receive a disbursement\\nfor the third subscription period and for each subsequent subscription period in the program, a student must have\\ncompleted a cumulative number of credit hours equal to the total number of hours for which the student was enrolled in\\nall previously attended subscription periods in the program, excluding the number of hours for which the student was\\nenrolled in the most recently attended subscription period.\\nThe cumulative number of hours that a student must have completed to receive a disbursement for the third subscription\\nperiod and for each subsequent subscription period is based on the student\\'s enrollment status for the program. Each\\nsubscription period that a student attends is associated with a number of credit hours based on the student\\'s enrollment\\nstatus. A school establishes an enrollment status (for example, full-time or half-time) that will apply to a student\\nthroughout the student\\'s enrollment in a subscription-based program, except that a student may change their enrollment\\nstatus no more often than once per academic year. For example, if the program is a full-time program and the school\\'s\\nfull-time standard is 12 semester or quarter hours, each subscription period will be associated with 12 hours. For a\\nstudent receiving Pell Grants in a subscription-based program, the student9s enrollment intensity would correspond to the\\nenrollment status established for the program and would not vary. For example, in a full-time subscription-based program\\nthe student9s enrollment intensity would be set at 100%, and in a half-time program it would be set at 50%. (See Volume\\n7, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining Pell Grant enrollment intensity in other types of programs.) As a student\\nprogresses through a subscription-based program, the number of hours associated with each term are added to the\\ncumulative total needed for the student to receive a disbursement.\\nFor the first two terms in a subscription-based program, a school can make a disbursement of Title IV funds up to 10 days\\nbefore the beginning of the subscription period. Beginning with the third subscription period, early disbursement 10 days\\nbefore the beginning of the term is allowed only if at that point the student has completed the required number of credit\\nhours to receive a disbursement for the term.

Unlike scholarship programs that may\\naward funds based on academic merit or the student9s field of study, <need-based= grants, loans, and work-study are\\nbased on the student9s demonstrated financial need for assistance. The cost of attendance (COA) is the cornerstone of\\nestablishing a student9s financial need, as it sets a limit on the total aid that a student may receive for purposes of the\\nCampus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs, and is one of the basic components of the Pell Grant calculation.\\nThis chapter picks up at the point where the Student Aid Index (SAI) for a student has been determined. See Chapter 3 of\\nthe Application and Verification Guide for more information on the SAI, and Volume 1 for more information on basic\\nstudent eligibility requirements. Most schools establish average costs for different categories of students and set these\\ncost categories in EDExpress or other software that they use to determine awards and package aid. The typical costs that\\nyou establish for your students will be used to calculate their Title IV award amounts and package their aid.\\nAllowable Costs\\nThe HEA specifies the types of costs that are included in the COA, but each school must determine the appropriate and\\nreasonable amounts to include for each eligible COA category for its students, based on the criteria described in this\\nchapter.\\nThe COA for a student is an estimate of that student9s educational expenses for the period of enrollment. As you9ll see, in\\nmost cases you can use average expenses (for students with the same enrollment status) at your school, rather than\\nactual expenses. For example, for the tuition and fees component, you can use the same average amount for all full-time\\nstudents instead of figuring the actual tuition and fees for each individual student. You can have different standard costs\\nfor different categories of students, such as one COA for out-of-state students, who are charged higher tuition, and a\\ndifferent COA for in-state students, who are charged lower tuition. However, you cannot combine the COA figures for each\\nseparate enrollment status and award aid to a student based on the average COA. Students must be awarded based on a\\nCOA comprised of allowable costs assessed all students carrying the same academic workload.\\nIf a student is enrolled in a program that has extra fees or costs, such as lab fees, you can add those fees to the student9s\\ncost or use a standard cost that you9ve established for all students in that program. If you establish standard cost\\ncategories, you must apply the cost allowances uniformly to all students in those categories.\\nThere are a variety of methods to arrive at average costs for your students, such as conducting periodic surveys of your\\nstudent population, assessing local housing costs or other pertinent data, or other reasonable methods you may devise\\nwhich generate accurate average costs for various categories of students.\\nThe types of costs that may be included are the same for all Title IV programs. For the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and\\nDirect Loan programs, the COA, based on the student9s enrollment status, is a student9s cost for the period for which the\\naid is intended. For Pell Grants, the COA is always the full-year costs for a full-time student, so you may have to prorate\\nactual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an academic year (or who are less than full time in a\\nterm-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods longer than an academic year. Note that\\nthough certain components are excluded from the Pell Grant COA for a student who is enrolled on a less-than-half-time\\nbasis, the components that are included in the less-than-half-time Pell Grant COA are still based on the full-year costs for\\na full-time student for a Pell Grant recipient with an enrollment intensity below 50%. See Volume 7 for guidance on Pell\\nGrant requirements.\\nThe types of costs included in the COA are determined by section 472 of the HEA and are the only costs that may be\\nincluded in a student9s COA. If a cost is not listed below, it may not be included as part of the COA.\\nUnless it is specifically noted in the discussion of COA categories below that a particular category applies only to students\\nwho are enrolled at least half time, the types of expenses that may be included in the COA are the same for all students,\\nregardless of enrollment status.\\nTuition and Fees'),\n",

For instance, if the greater of the average and median\\namounts charged to students living in freshmen dormitories is $15,000 per year, and the greater of the average and\\nmedian amounts charged to students living in graduate housing is $20,000 per year, those amounts could be used as\\nthe housing allowances for all students living in each type of institutional housing.\\nBecause schools are free to create as many different types of this allowance as they choose, if the amounts charged\\nto students for all institutional housing of a specific type are the same or do not differ significantly, such an approach\\nwould likely result in allowances for each housing type that are equal or close to the actual costs charged.

A period of non-attendance is a\\nperiod during which the student is not enrolled and is not otherwise engaged in any activity that is a requirement of the\\nstudent9s program of study. For example, if a student does not attend a module in a term that is divided into multiple\\nmodules or does not attend an intersession that falls between two terms, you may not include any costs associated with\\nthat module or intersession. This applies even if the module or intersession forms part of a standard term in which the\\nstudent is otherwise enrolled (see Chapter 1 of this volume for more information on the treatment of modules and\\nintersessions), or if the student is studying for a test or coursework related to an eligible program during the period of\\nnon-attendance (though the costs of such a test itself may be an allowable COA component4see <Costs of Obtaining a\\nLicense, Certification, or First Professional Credential= earlier in this chapter).\\nAdjustments for Special Circumstances\\nYou have the authority to use professional judgment to adjust the COA on a case-by-case basis to allow for special\\ncircumstances. Such adjustments must be documented in the student9s file. (See <Professional Judgment= in Chapter 5 of\\nthe Application and Verification Guide.)\\nLimitations to Tuition and Fees Component\\nTuition Discounting\\nIn establishing the tuition and fees component of the COA for Title IV aid applicants, you must use an amount that is\\nrequired for all students in the same course of study. Therefore, a recipient of Title IV aid cannot be assessed charges that\\nare higher than what is charged to a student not receiving aid under the Title IV programs.\\nOffering a discount to students who pay early is not permitted because Title IV recipients may not be able to (and should\\nnot be required to) meet that requirement, and therefore students who do not pay early would effectively be assessed a\\nhigher tuition amount than other students. Of course, it would be permissible for you to provide the discount to all Title IV\\neligible students without regard to when their charges are paid. However, doing so would require an adjustment to such\\nstudents9 COA.\\nOvertime Charges\\nSome schools may assess overtime charges for students who fail to complete their academic programs within the normal\\ntime frame. Section 472 of the HEA defines COA as the tuition and fees normally assessed a student carrying the same\\nacademic workload required of all students in the same course of study. Since overtime charges are not charges that are\\nnormally assessed (they are in addition to normal tuition and fees), they may not be included in a student9s COA for Title\\nIV purposes, and therefore Title IV funds may not be used to pay overtime charges, even if a school obtains a student9s (or\\nparent9s) authorization to do so.'),\n",

Although this section discusses this concept in\\nterms of tuition and fee charges, it applies to any of the components of a student9s COA.\\nIn some cases, such as under Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) programs, a student9s tuition and fees are\\npaid by another organization or are waived. The student9s costs are based on what the school is actually charging the\\nstudent, as specified in the agreement between the school and the student.\\nIf the student is charged for the tuition and fees, even if the charge is eventually paid by someone other than the student\\n(e.g., a scholarship agency or other source of aid), then that tuition and fee amount is included in the COA in most\\ncircumstances. The tuition and fees payment would then be counted as OFA. The charge is documented in the same way\\nas for any non-WIOA student (for instance, in your school9s contract with the student or in the agreement with the WIOA\\nagency). If your school charges the student for tuition and fees, your school would have to expect the student to pay the\\ncharge if the WIOA agency or other source of assistance doesn9t pay on the student9s behalf.\\nIf the student is never charged for tuition and fees, then the COA wouldn9t include the tuition and fees component. Some\\nWIOA agreements with schools provide that the school can9t charge the tuition and fees to the student, even if WIOA\\ndoesn9t cover the costs. If your school is prohibited under such an agreement from charging tuition and fees to the\\nstudent, then the tuition and fees aren9t included in the student9s COA, and, therefore, that amount would not be included\\nas OFA.\\nEven if there9s no tuition and fees component, the student9s budget still includes the other costs listed previously, such as\\nan allowance for living expenses.

If the student doesn9t fulfill the terms of the contract, the school\\nis left with an unpaid tuition and fees charge. The school isn9t permitted to hold the student liable for the unpaid tuition\\nand fees. Contracts are established this way to offer schools an incentive to properly train and place students enrolled in\\nthe training programs. However, if a tuition and fees charge is included in a Title IV aid recipient9s budget, the student\\nwould be liable for any outstanding charges that are not reimbursed by WIOA. Therefore, schools that enter into\\nreimbursement contracts must remove the tuition and fees component from the Title IV budget because, under these\\ncontracts, schools are prohibited from holding the student liable for outstanding charges.\\nEffects of Waivers on COA\\nIf your school treats a waiver as a payment of tuition and fees that have been charged to a student, then the waiver is\\nconsidered OFA and the full amount of the tuition and fees are included in a student9s COA.\\nOn the other hand, if the student is never assessed the full charges, the waiver is not considered to be financial aid, and\\nonly the charges actually assessed the student would be included in the student9s COA.\\nVolume 3, Chapter 2, Example 1: Housing and Food Waiver\\nA school saves some of its resident assistant jobs for students with exceptional financial need.

If the program\\nis longer than an academic year, for Direct Loans and Campus-Based aid the tuition costs apply only to the first period of\\nenrollment. For example, if a school charges the entire $10,000 tuition cost for a program up front, the $10,000 will be\\nincluded in the first academic year9s COA when packaging Direct Loans and Campus-Based aid but would not be included\\nin the second academic year9s COA components.

The general rule in packaging is\\nthat the student9s need-based aid must not exceed the student9s financial need, and total financial aid and other financial\\nassistance (OFA) must not exceed the student9s cost of attendance (COA). If you discover that a student9s aid package\\nexceeds the student9s financial need or COA, you must attempt to adjust the aid package to eliminate the overaward. See\\nVolume 4, Chapter 3 for guidance on handling overawards and overpayments.\\nPackaging Overview\\nFor some Title IV programs, eligibility is limited to students who have financial need. Students are considered to have\\nfinancial need if their COA exceeds their SAI. These <need-based= programs include the Federal Pell Grant, Federal\\nSupplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG), Federal Work-Study (FWS), and Direct Subsidized Loan programs.\\nThe total aid that a student receives from need-based programs may not exceed the student9s financial need. Pell Grants\\nare the first source of aid for students with financial need. A student9s eligibility for aid from the other need-based\\nprograms is then determined by subtracting the student9s SAI and OFA (including the student9s Pell Grant) from the COA\\n(see <Treatment of Negative SAIs= later in the chapter for guidance on packaging need-based aid for students with\\nnegative SAIs):\\nCOA 3 SAI 3 OFA = remaining need\\nFor other Title IV programs, eligibility is not based on the student9s financial need. These <non-need-based= programs\\ninclude the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, and\\nDirect PLUS Loan programs. A student9s eligibility for non-need-based aid is determined by subtracting OFA (including any\\nneed-based aid) from the COA:\\nCOA 3 OFA = eligibility for non-need-based aid\\nAs explained later in this chapter, non-need-based aid may be used to replace the SAI.\\nDepending on individual circumstances, students may receive only need-based aid, only non-need-based aid, or a\\ncombination of both types of aid. In general, the total amount of need-based aid cannot exceed the student9s financial\\nneed and the total amount of all aid cannot exceed the student9s COA. However, there are some exceptions to the normal\\npackaging process under certain circumstances or for certain Title IV programs, as we explain later in this chapter.\\nThe COA for the Campus-Based, TEACH Grant, and Direct Loan programs is based on the student9s enrollment status and\\ncosts for the period for which the aid is intended. The COA used for the Pell Grant Program is always the full-year costs for\\na full-time student, so you may have to prorate actual or average costs up for students who are attending less than an\\nacademic year (or who are part-time in a term-based program) or prorate down for students who are attending for periods\\nlonger than an academic year (see Volume 7 for more information).\\nThe process of awarding aid without exceeding the student9s financial need (for need-based aid) or COA (for total aid\\nreceived) is traditionally called packaging. Packaging is a process that varies from school to school, depending on the\\ntypes of scholarship and other aid available at the school, and the characteristics of the student population. Schools may\\nhave different packaging philosophies, but they generally try to find the best combination of aid to meet the financial\\nneed of their students.\\nTo help you package federal student aid with your other aid awards, EDExpress includes a packaging module. You can\\nenter information about your school9s student aid programs and set up factors to be considered in packaging, and then\\nuse the software to automate the packaging process. Most schools use some form of packaging software, whether\\nEDExpress or software from a commercial vendor. You are not required to use EDExpress to package Title IV awards, and\\nyou do not have to report the student9s aid package to the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system.\\nNo Alternate SAIs for Periods Other Than Nine Months'),\n",

The FAFSA Simplification Act eliminated this provision. Beginning with\\nthe 2024-2025 award year, when packaging aid for any period that is not nine months, schools must use a student9s\\ncalculated 9-month SAI in the formula to determine eligibility for need-based aid, as described above (that is, COA 3 SAI 3\\nOFA = need). As a result of this change, students who are enrolled for periods shorter than nine months will have less\\nfinancial need than would have been the case in the past when using an alternate (smaller) EFC for such periods. See\\nVolume 8, Chapter 3 for more information on how this change may affect Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for students\\nreceiving loans for periods of enrollment (loan periods) shorter than nine months.\\nTreatment of Negative SAIs\\nA student may have a calculated SAI that is a negative number as low as -1,500. Also, as explained in Chapter 3 of the\\nApplication and Verification Guide, certain students will automatically receive a -1,500 SAI. When packaging need-based\\naid for students with negative SAIs, schools must convert any negative SAIs to zero for awarding purposes. This means\\nthat a negative SAI will not increase the amount of need-based aid a student can receive. Note that a negative SAI also\\ndoes not increase the amount of non-need-based aid that a student may receive because the SAI is not a factor in\\ndetermining eligibility for aid that isn9t based on financial need.\\nPackaging Rules\\nPell Grants as the First Source of Aid\\nPell Grants are the first source of aid for a student, and packaging Title IV funds begins with determining a student9s Pell\\nGrant eligibility, as described in Volume 7. A correctly determined Pell Grant is never adjusted to take into account other\\nforms of aid. When awarding aid from the other Title IV programs, you must ensure that the student9s need or COA is not\\nexceeded.\\nIn some cases, a student9s aid package may include a Pell Grant and non-Title IV aid (for example, institutional aid or\\nprivate education loans), but no other types of Title IV aid, and the combination of the Pell Grant and the other aid may be\\nlarge enough to exceed the student9s COA. For instance, the National Collegiate Athletic Association9s (NCAA's) rules for\\nathletic aid may permit a school to award athletic aid that covers a student9s full COA (see <NCAA Considerations= in\\nChapter 2 of this volume for more information). In this case, the student is still eligible for the full amount of the Pell\\nGrant. However, you can9t award any Title IV funds other than the Pell Grant.\\nNote that in some cases a student9s SAI may be higher than the COA, resulting in no financial need, but the student may\\nstill qualify for a calculated Pell Grant or a minimum Pell Grant (see Volume 7, Chapter 2 for more information on Pell\\nGrant eligibility criteria). As an example, consider a student with an SAI of 6,650, a COA of $5,500, and a calculated Pell\\nGrant amount of $745. In this circumstance the student is still eligible for the full Pell Grant amount (as long as it doesn9t\\nexceed the COA), but you may not award any other types of need-based Title IV aid.\\nIf a student9s aid package includes a Pell Grant, other types of Title IV aid, and non-Title IV aid, and the total aid amount\\nexceeds the student9s COA, the student still qualifies for the full Pell Grant amount, but you must adjust the other Title IV\\naid to ensure that the COA is not exceeded.\\nIn the circumstances described above you may (but are not required to) adjust non-Title IV aid over which you have\\ncontrol in accordance with your school9s policies.\\nNo Alternate SAIs and Treatment of Negative SAIs\\nDCL GEN-23-11\\nDCL GEN-24-05\"),\n",

See Volume 7,\\nChapter 8 for more detail on the effects of various levels of Pell Grant LEU.\\nConsidering Grants and Subsidized Loans First\\nThe law requires aid administrators to determine whether a student is eligible for aid from certain other Title IV programs\\nthat would reduce the need for borrowing. If your school participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program, you must include\\nthe student9s estimated Pell Grant eligibility as OFA when making Campus-Based awards, whether or not the student has\\nreceived the Pell Grant at the time you make your Campus-Based award.\\nSimilarly, you must determine an undergraduate student9s Pell Grant eligibility before originating a Direct Subsidized or\\nUnsubsidized Loan for that student, and you must package Campus-Based funds and Direct Subsidized Loans before\\nDirect Unsubsidized Loans. In addition, you must determine an undergraduate student9s maximum Direct Subsidized Loan\\neligibility before originating a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the student (see Volume 8, Chapter 1 for an explanation of the\\ndifference between Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans). However, if a student has received a\\ndetermination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan that is $200 or less, you have the option of including that amount as\\npart of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan and are not required to originate a separate Direct Subsidized Loan for the student.\\nFor a dependent student, you may originate and disburse a parent Direct PLUS Loan without determining the student9s\\nPell Grant and Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility. However, if the student on whose behalf the parent is borrowing receives\\nPell Grant funds and/or other types of aid for the same period of enrollment, that other aid must be considered when\\ndetermining the Direct PLUS Loan amount that the parent is eligible to borrow. The amount of a parent Direct PLUS Loan\\ncannot exceed the student9s COA minus other financial assistance that the student has received.\\nDetermining Pell Grant eligibility is not relevant when awarding Direct PLUS Loans to graduate or professional students,\\nbut you must determine a graduate or professional student9s maximum Direct Unsubsidized Loan eligibility before you\\noriginate a Direct PLUS Loan for the student.\\nRequirement to Consider Federal Pell Grants First\\n34 CFR 685.200(a)(1)(iii)\\nVolume 3, Chapter 3, Example 1: Basic Packaging\\nA dependent second-year undergraduate student has a COA of $12,500 and an SAI of 2,500 for the current year.\\nThe SAI is subtracted from the COA, leaving the student with $10,000 in unmet need:\\n$12,500 COA\\n- 2,500 SAI\\n$10,000 need\\nThe aid administrator begins by awarding a Pell Grant and applying an outside scholarship before awarding\\nCampus-Based aid.

As noted in\\nChapter 1, it9s usually best to originate a loan for a period that matches the academic year or other period that you9re\\nusing to award funds from other Title IV programs. The amount of a private education loan which exceeds the SAI when\\nsubstituting for the SAI is considered OFA.\\nWhen classifying non-Title IV sources of aid, if a student receives the award because of postsecondary enrollment (for\\nexample, a scholarship from a local social club that requires a student to be attending a postsecondary school), it counts\\nas OFA if it is not considered wages for employment according to federal or state rules, or if it is considered wages and is\\nbased on need.

Employment with a state is considered OFA if that\\nemployment is based on the student9s financial need for assistance to pay for educational expenses.\\nNon-need-based earnings are not to be considered as OFA for the current award year because they will be reported as\\nincome on the FAFSA form for a subsequent award year and will be used in calculating the future SAI. An example of non-\\nneed-based employment would be a student's job with a private employer such as a local grocery store. Another example\\nwould be a job cleaning the labs in the chemistry department on campus, if the chemistry department hired the student\\nusing non-need-based criteria and funds.\\nExclusion of Emergency Financial Assistance From OFA\\nUnder the FAFSA Simplification Act, emergency financial assistance provided to a student is excluded from OFA when\\nawarding Title IV funds. For this purpose, emergency financial assistance includes any grant or loan aid (whether\\ninstitutional funds or aid from some other non-Title IV source) paid to a student for unexpected expenses, if those\\nexpenses are associated with one of the allowable COA components as described in Chapter 2 of this volume. This could\\ninclude, for example, unexpected expenses for food; housing; course materials or equipment; or transportation (for\\ninstance, transportation between campus and home for a death or family emergency), since those expense categories are\\nallowable COA components. The school is responsible for determining whether an unexpected expense is associated with\\na COA component. In addition, the expenses must not already be included in one of the student9s COA components. Note\\nalso that the determination as to whether emergency financial assistance is warranted is made by the school based on an\\nindividual student9s circumstances and need not be tied to a state or federal declaration of a disaster or emergency.\\nBefore providing aid to a student who has requested emergency financial assistance, a school must document the\\nrequest, including the unexpected expense that prompted the request, and should retain the documentation in the\\nstudent9s file for the normal record retention period (see Volume 2, Chapter 7 for information on record retention\\nrequirements).\\nTreatment of NIL compensation in awarding Title IV assistance: GEN-21-08\\nExclusion of State-Provided Assistance\\nHEA Sec. 480(j)\"),\n",

Therefore, if your school chooses to\\nrecalculate Pell Grants and TEACH Grants for a student whose enrollment intensity or enrollment status in a program\\nincreases (for example, from half-time to full-time), it must also recalculate for a student whose enrollment intensity or\\nstatus decreases.\\nOnce you have recalculated a student9s eligibility, Title IV funds in excess of the amount the student is eligible to receive\\nmust be returned or re-awarded, as applicable. For guidance on handling excess cash resulting from recalculations of aid\\neligibility due to enrollment intensity or status changes, see Volume 4, Chapter 1.\\nRecalculation and Direct Loans\\nIf a student9s enrollment status changes after the student has already received one or more Direct Loan disbursements,\\nno recalculation of the previously disbursed Direct Loan amount is required. For information on how changes in enrollment\\nstatus may affect a student9s eligibility to receive pending Direct Loan disbursements, see Volume 8, Chapter 1.\\nRecalculation and Pell Grants\\nSince Pell Grants are always based on the full-time COA, recalculation means that you are looking at the student9s revised\\nenrollment intensity. For more detail on recalculating Pell Grants, see Volume 7, Chapter 7.\\nRecalculating COA\\nWhen performing a recalculation a school may not include in the COA costs associated with any classes the student failed\\nto begin. In addition, in determining a student9s COA a school may not include any costs for a period when the student\\nwas not enrolled in and attending any Title IV eligible classes (other than costs for a brief period between regularly\\nscheduled terms or semesters). Note that some components of COA are not included if a student is enrolled less than half\\ntime (see Chapter 2 of this volume).\\nA school that performs a Return of Title IV Funds calculation on a period of enrollment basis for a student enrolled in a\\nprogram offered in modules may not include in the recalculated COA any costs associated with a future payment period\\nfor which the student has not confirmed attendance at the time of withdrawal and that does not start within 45 days.\\nCOA Changes Between or Within Payment Periods\\nA school may have a policy of recalculating awards only when the COA changes from one payment period to the next, and\\nnot when the COA changes within a payment period. For example, a school could recalculate awards because of changes\\nto a student9s tuition and fee costs or living situation (e.g., when a student moves off campus) between payment periods.\\nHowever, schools also have the option to establish a policy of recalculating financial aid awards when a student9s costs\\nchange within a payment period. For instance, if a student with no dependents moves from a dormitory to off-campus\\nhousing at midterm, a school could choose to recalculate the student9s award for that payment period. For Pell Grant\\npurposes, such a policy is acceptable if it9s carried out for all students whose costs change within the payment period.\\nNote that schools are not limited to one or the other of the policies described above. Schools may have a policy of\\nrecalculating awards when there is a change in costs at any time during an award year (whether within a payment period\\nor between payment periods), as long as the recalculation policy is carried out for all students whose costs change.\\nSchools may not recalculate the payment for a payment period that took place before the cost change. For instance, if a\\nstudent lives in the dormitory during the first quarter and then moves off campus for the second and third quarters, the\\nrecalculation would only affect the payments for the second and third quarters.\\nCrossover Periods\\nCrossover periods are payment, award, or loan periods that overlap two award years. With one exception, you may\\nchoose which award year SAI to use for a student. The exception is that when awarding FWS to a student not attending\\nclasses, the SAI for the next period of enrollment must be used.\\nTable 2 at the end of this section summarizes the options for handling crossover payment periods in the Title IV programs.\\nNote that for the award year selected, the student must have an official SAI calculated by the FAFSA Processing System\\n(FPS), and for a Pell Grant the FPS must also have processed a valid Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) or'),\n",

This chapter discusses other eligibility requirements that are\\nspecific to the Direct Loan Program.\\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans\\nOnly students who have financial need may receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The federal government does not charge\\ninterest on Direct Subsidized Loans while the borrower is enrolled on at least a half-time basis, during the grace and\\ndeferment periods, and during certain other periods (for example, during certain periods of repayment under certain\\nrepayment plans that determine the required monthly payment amount based on the borrower9s income and family size).\\nIf a student has received a determination of need for a Direct Subsidized Loan in an amount of $200 or less, a school may\\nchoose not to originate a Direct Subsidized Loan and may instead include that amount as part of a Direct Unsubsidized\\nLoan.\\nFinancial need is not an eligibility requirement to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan. The federal government generally\\ncharges interest on Direct Unsubsidized Loans during all periods, with limited exceptions (for example, during periods of\\ndeferment for cancer treatment).\\nTo be eligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, an undergraduate student attending a\\nschool that participates in the Federal Pell Grant Program must first have received a determination of their Pell Grant\\neligibility for the period of enrollment for which the student is requesting a loan.\\nNo Minimum Age To Receive a Direct Loan\\nStudents who are minors may receive Direct Loans, but they may not refuse to repay the loans based on a <defense of\\ninfancy= (that is, by claiming that they were too young to enter into the contract of signing the promissory note).\\nRequirement To Offer Both Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans\\nDirect Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are two components of a single loan program.

For instance, under these circumstances a dependent\\nsecond-year undergraduate could receive up to $6,500 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds (see Chapter 4 of this volume\\nfor information on annual loan limits). However, the student may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans or aid from any of\\nthe other Title IV programs.\\nSelf-certification from the dependent student is not sufficient to verify that the parents have ended financial support or\\nhave refused to complete the FAFSA form. In most cases, this requirement can be met by obtaining a signed and dated\\nstatement from one of the student9s parents. For more information, see the discussion under <Dependent students\\nwithout parent support= in the <Professional Judgment= section of Chapter 5 of the Application and Verification Guide.\\nDirect PLUS Loans\\nDirect PLUS Loans are available to graduate and professional students, and to the parents of dependent undergraduate\\nstudents.\\nA parent may receive a Direct PLUS Loan only to pay for the education costs of a dependent undergraduate student who\\nmeets the eligible student definition. A parent borrower must meet the same citizenship and residency requirements as a\\nstudent. Similarly, a parent who is in default on a Title IV loan, or who owes an overpayment on a Title IV grant, is\\nineligible for a Direct PLUS Loan unless they have made satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan or grant. A parent\\nwho had a prior Title IV loan discharged for total and permanent disability must meet the same eligibility requirements\\noutlined for student borrowers in Volume 1, Chapter 3. Finally, a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan if the federal\\ngovernment holds a judgment lien on their property or if the parent is incarcerated. Note, however, that a parent9s\\nineligibility for a Direct PLUS Loan does not affect the student9s eligibility for other Title IV aid, assuming that the student\\nis otherwise eligible.\\nRequirement To Offer Direct PLUS Loans to Both Student and Parent Borrowers\\nSchools may choose whether to offer Direct PLUS Loans. If your school chooses to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan\\nProgram and has both undergraduate and graduate or professional students, you must make Direct PLUS Loans available\\nto both the parents of dependent undergraduate students and to graduate or professional students. You may not limit\\nDirect PLUS Loan borrowing only to parents or only to graduate or professional students.

It is not a requirement for the parent borrower to\\nsubmit a FAFSA form in the parent9s name, and it does not preclude an otherwise eligible parent whose information is not\\nincluded on the FAFSA form (sometimes referred to as a <non-custodial= parent) from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan.\\nBefore originating a Direct PLUS Loan for a parent borrower, schools must review the ISIR or FAFSA Submission Summary\\nof the dependent student to ensure there are no student eligibility issues that must be resolved before the parent can\\nreceive the Direct PLUS Loan.\\nAdverse Credit History\\nAn individual with an adverse credit history is prohibited from obtaining a Direct PLUS Loan unless they meet additional\\neligibility requirements. The Department obtains a credit report on each student or parent applicant for a Direct PLUS\\nLoan. An applicant is considered to have an adverse credit history if:\\nThey have one or more debts with a total combined outstanding balance greater than $2,085 that (1) are 90 or more\\ndays delinquent as of the date of the credit report, or (2) have been placed in collection or charged-off during the two\\nyears preceding the date of the credit report; or\\nDuring the five years preceding the date of the credit report, the applicant has been determined to be in default on a\\ndebt; has had debts discharged in bankruptcy; or has been the subject of foreclosure, repossession, tax lien, wage\\ngarnishment, or write-off of a Title IV debt.\\nFor Direct PLUS Loan eligibility purposes, <charged-off= means a debt that has been written off as a loss, but that is still\\nsubject to collection action. <In collection= means a debt that has been placed with a collection agency by a creditor or\\nthat is subject to more intensive efforts by a creditor to recover amounts owed from a borrower who has not responded\\nsatisfactorily to the routine demands of the creditor9s billing procedures.\\nAn applicant cannot be denied a Direct PLUS Loan because they have no credit history. That is, the absence of a credit\\nhistory is not considered to be adverse credit.\\nThere are two means by which a Direct PLUS Loan applicant with an adverse credit history can still qualify for a Direct\\nPLUS Loan. One option is for the applicant to obtain an endorser who doesn9t have an adverse credit history. An endorser\\nis someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower doesn9t repay it. For a parent borrower, the\\nendorser may not be the dependent student for whom the parent is borrowing.\\nAs an alternative to obtaining an endorser, an applicant who has been determined to have an adverse credit history may\\nalso qualify for a Direct PLUS Loan by submitting documentation to the Department showing that there are extenuating\\ncircumstances associated with the adverse credit. The Department has the final decision on determining whether\\nextenuating circumstances exist.\\nA borrower who qualifies for a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser or documenting to the satisfaction of the\\nDepartment that extenuating circumstances exist must also complete PLUS Loan Credit Counseling, as discussed below.'),\n",

Entrance counseling is not required for parent Direct PLUS Loan borrowers.\\nFor this purpose, a first-time Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan borrower is someone who has not\\nreceived a prior Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Unsubsidized Federal\\nStafford Loan, or Federal Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS) Loan. In the case of a graduate or professional student\\nwho requests a Direct PLUS Loan, a first-time Direct PLUS Loan borrower is someone who has not received a prior student\\nDirect PLUS Loan or student Federal PLUS Loan. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, Federal SLS Loans,\\nand Federal PLUS Loans are loan types that were made under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program before\\nthe authority to make new FFEL Program loans ended effective July 1, 2010.\\nBefore making the first disbursement of a Direct Subsidized Loan, Direct Unsubsidized Loan, or student Direct PLUS Loan\\nto a first-time borrower, you must ensure that the student receives entrance counseling.\\nEntrance counseling provides borrowers with comprehensive information on the terms and conditions of the loan they are\\nabout to receive, and their responsibility to repay the loan. This information may be provided during an in-person\\ncounseling session, on a separate written form that the borrower signs and returns to the school, or online or by\\ninteractive electronic means, with the borrower acknowledging receipt of the information.\\nIf entrance counseling is conducted online or through interactive electronic means, your school must take reasonable\\nsteps to ensure that students finish the counseling, which may include completing a test of their understanding of the\\nterms and conditions of the loan. If a standardized, interactive electronic tool is used for counseling, you must give the\\nborrower any required information that is not addressed in the tool either in person or in a separate written or electronic\\ndocument.\\nYour school must have someone with expertise in the Title IV programs reasonably available shortly after the counseling\\nto answer students9 questions. As an alternative, if students are enrolled in an approved correspondence, distance\\neducation, or study-abroad program, they may be provided with written counseling materials before the loan is disbursed.\\nYou may not require students to complete additional counseling beyond entrance counseling. However, your entrance\\ncounseling policy can require more than the minimum specified by the regulations as long as the additional requirements\\nare reasonable as to time, effort, and relevance to the students9 borrowing and are not administered in a way that\\nunreasonably impedes students9 ability to receive Direct Loans in a timely manner.

Before originating a Direct Loan, a\\nschool must determine the student9s or parent9s eligibility for the loan. For each Direct Loan that a school disburses to a\\nstudent or parent, the school must submit a loan award record to the COD System that includes the student9s grade level,\\nthe loan period and academic year dates, the loan amount, the anticipated and actual dates and amounts of the loan\\ndisbursements, and other information. Submission of a loan award record serves as the school9s certification that it has\\ndetermined the borrower9s eligibility for the loan.\\nThe specific Direct Loan amount that a student or parent borrower is eligible to receive is determined based on various\\nfactors such as the student9s COA, Student Aid Index (SAI), OFA, and remaining eligibility under the annual and aggregate\\nloan limits (see Chapter 4 for guidance on annual and aggregate loan limits). Some of these factors are relevant only\\nwhen determining eligibility for certain types of Direct Loans. When originating a Direct Loan, the COA used in\\ndetermining the loan amount may include only those costs associated with the period of enrollment (loan period) for\\nwhich the loan is being originated.\\nDirect Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans have annual and aggregate limits that are the same for all\\nstudents at a given grade level and dependency status. You may not originate a Direct Loan for an amount that:\\nExceeds the amount requested by the borrower;\\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus the student9s SAI and OFA;\\nIn the case of a Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Direct PLUS Loan, exceeds the student9s COA minus OFA; or\\nIn the case of a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, would cause the student to exceed the annual or\\naggregate limit.\\nSee Volume 3, Chapter 3 for more information on packaging Direct Loans as part of a student9s financial aid award.\\nOriginating a Loan\\nIt9s important to remember that your school, not the Department, is responsible for determining a borrower9s eligibility for\\na Direct Loan. Schools that originate and disburse loans to ineligible borrowers, or for loan amounts that exceed loan\\nlimits or financial need, are subject to administrative actions such as a fine, limitation, suspension, and termination, as\\nwell as liabilities including repayment to the government of interest and costs it has paid on the ineligible loans.\\nYou must originate a Direct Loan while the student is enrolled and eligible for the period of enrollment for which the loan\\nis intended. You may not originate a loan for a period in which the student is no longer enrolled. For example, you may\\nnot originate a loan for a prior academic year that has ended, even if the student is enrolled and eligible for the current\\nacademic year. Similarly, if a student who was enrolled at least half time only for the fall and spring quarters of an\\nacademic year consisting of fall, winter, and spring quarters does not request a loan until the spring, you may not at that\\ntime originate a loan for the previous fall quarter.\\nFor all Direct Loans, you must document the student9s COA, SAI, and OFA in the student9s file. This information must be\\nmade available to the Department upon request.\\nYou must confirm that the borrower meets the definition of eligible borrower by doing the following:\\nDetermine that the student is enrolled at least half time and making satisfactory academic progress (see Volume 1);\\nReview the NSLDS information on the ISIR or the NSLDS Professional Access website to ensure that the student is not\\nin default, does not owe an overpayment on a Title IV grant or loan (see Volume 1), and will not exceed the annual or\\naggregate loan limits (as described in Chapter 4 of this volume);\\nEnsure that the amount of the loan, in combination with other aid, will not exceed the student9s financial need or'),\n",

However, as explained in Volume 3, Chapter 3, there are no\\nalternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine months comparable to the alternate EFCs for periods other than\\nnine months that were used prior to the 2024-2025 award year. In all cases you must use the student9s full calculated 9-\\nmonth SAI in the formula to determine financial need for Direct Subsidized Loans and other need-based aid even though\\nthe COA will reflect the reduced costs for the shorter loan period. This means that students enrolled for periods shorter\\nthan nine months will have less financial need than would have been the case in the past when using a smaller alternate\\nEFC, because now the full calculated SAI must be subtracted from the reduced COA for the shorter period of enrollment\\nwhen determining financial need for purposes of Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.\\nVolume 8, Chapter 3, Example 1: Effect of No Alternate SAI on Financial Need When Originating Loans for Periods\\nLess Than Nine Months\\nA first-year dependent student has a COA of $10,800 for an academic year consisting of the fall and spring\\nsemesters and an SAI of 8,000, so the student9s financial need for the fall-spring enrollment period is $2,800 (see\\nVolume 3, Chapter 3 for guidance on determining financial need). The student is not eligible for a Pell Grant and\\nreceives no Title IV aid except for Direct Loans. The student qualifies for a $2,800 Direct Subsidized Loan to fully\\ncover their financial need. (The student could also receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, but for purposes of this\\nexample we cover only Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility.)\\nThe student will also be enrolled for the summer term, which the school treats as a <trailer= to the preceding fall-\\nspring Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits (see Chapter 6 of this\\nVolume). The summer term is four months in length and the COA for that term is $4,000. For students who attend\\nthe summer term and request Direct Loan funds, the school9s normal practice is to originate a separate loan for\\nthe summer term only. Because there is no alternate SAI for periods of enrollment less than nine months and the\\nstudent9s SAI of 8,000 is greater than the summer term COA, the student has no financial need for summer and is\\ntherefore ineligible to receive a Direct Subsidized Loan for that term (but could receive a Direct Unsubsidized\\nLoan).\\nAs an alternative to originating a separate summer-only loan, the school could choose to originate a single loan\\nfor a loan period covering the fall-spring SAY plus the summer trailer term. The student9s COA for that period of\\nenrollment is $14,800. Subtracting the student9s SAI of 8,000 from the COA results in financial need of $6,800.\\nThe student would therefore be eligible to receive a $3,500 Direct Subsidized Loan (the maximum subsidized\\nannual loan limit for a dependent first-year student) for the fall-spring-summer loan period.'),\n",

Other circumstances when you must update loan data in the COD System include:\\nWhen the borrower requests the cancellation of a loan or a loan disbursement;\\nWhen the borrower does not begin attendance, or does not begin attendance on at least a half-time basis, in a\\npayment period that was included in the originally reported loan period and you did not make any disbursements for\\nthat payment period (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for information on payment periods);\\nWhen you determine that the borrower is not eligible to receive a Direct Loan for a payment period that was part of\\nthe originally reported loan period (for example, due to the borrower9s failure to meet SAP standards, because the\\nborrower has an overpayment, or because a change in circumstances makes the borrower ineligible for a subsidized\\nloan);\\nWhen the borrower withdraws during a payment period that was included in the originally reported loan period, and\\nas a result, the entire amount of the loan that was intended for that payment period is returned under the Return of\\nTitle IV Funds (R2T4) calculation;\\nFor clock-hour programs, non-term credit-hour programs, and certain types of nonstandard term credit-hour\\nprograms, when the borrower fails to progress to the next payment period or academic year as scheduled.\\nNote: In limited circumstances, it is not necessary to adjust the loan period for a Direct Loan if the borrower is ineligible\\nto receive a Direct Loan during one or more terms within the loan period due to not being enrolled or being enrolled on a\\nless-than-half-time basis.

If the student agrees to accept the unsubsidized loan funds and they also received a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for\\nthe same loan period as the Direct Subsidized Loan, you may increase the amount of the Direct Unsubsidized Loan\\ndisbursements by the amount of the Direct Subsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive. If the student did\\nnot receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, you may originate a new Direct Unsubsidized Loan for the amount of the Direct\\nSubsidized Loan that the student was ineligible to receive.

You may do this either by adjusting an existing Direct Subsidized Loan upwards, or, if the\\nstudent does not have an existing Direct Subsidized Loan, by originating a new Direct Subsidized Loan. Replacing a Direct\\nUnsubsidized Loan with a Direct Subsidized Loan in this circumstance does not require obtaining the student9s consent.\\nDirect Loan Overawards\\nAs explained in Volume 4, Chapter 3, an overaward exists when a student9s aid package exceeds their need or overall\\nCOA. If you discover that a student who received Direct Loans has been overawarded and your school has already\\nreceived and disbursed some or all of the Direct Loan funds, you have the following options:\\nIf the student9s aid package includes a Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a Direct PLUS Loan, or a nonfederal education loan,\\nand the aid package doesn9t already apply these loans toward the student9s SAI, you may choose to adjust the aid\\npackage to have all or a portion of these loans replace the SAI, thus reducing or eliminating the overaward (for more\\ndetail and examples, see <Substituting for the SAI= in Volume 3, Chapter 3).\\nIf you have not yet made the second or subsequent disbursement of a Direct Loan, you can reduce or cancel the\\nsecond or subsequent disbursement.\\nIf the overaward situation occurs after the full amount of a Direct Loan has been disbursed, you do not need to adjust the\\namount of the loan. However, you might have to adjust the aid package to prevent an overaward of Campus-Based funds\\nor to prevent the total aid package from exceeding the student9s need.\\nAlthough a school isn9t required to return Direct Loan funds that were disbursed to the borrower (either directly or by\\napplying them to the student's account) before the overaward situation occurred, the law doesn9t prevent your school\\nfrom returning funds that were applied to the student account if you choose to do so. A borrower who receives a direct\\npayment of loan funds is not required to repay an overawarded amount, unless the overaward was caused by the\\nborrower9s misreporting or withholding of information.\\nLoan Periods\\nThe loan period (also referred to as the <period of enrollment=) is the period for which a Direct Loan is intended. It must\\ncoincide with an academic period established by the school for which institutional charges are generally assessed (e.g.,\\nsemester, trimester, quarter, length of the student9s program, or academic year). It9s important to define the loan period\\nat the beginning of the loan awarding process, because the timing and amount of Direct Loan disbursements are tied to\\nthe loan period.\\nGenerally, the loan period may not include terms in which a student is ineligible (for example, if the student is not enrolled\\nduring a particular term or is enrolled less than half time during a term). There is a limited exception to this rule if the loan\\nperiod begins and ends with a term in which the student is eligible for Direct Loans, but the first and last terms of the loan\"),\n",

For example, if a student is expected to be\\nenrolled on at least a half-time basis in the fall and spring quarters of an academic year consisting of the fall, winter, and\\nspring quarters, but the student indicates that they do not plan to attend the winter quarter (or that they plan to be\\nenrolled on a less than half-time basis during that quarter), the school may still originate a loan for a loan period covering\\nthe fall, winter, and spring quarters. Of course, no costs associated with winter quarter may be included in the student9s\\nCOA when determining the loan amount the student is eligible to receive for the fall and spring quarters. Similarly, if a\\nschool initially originates a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period based on a student9s anticipated enrollment status of\\nat least half time during all three quarters, but the student subsequently does not attend the winter quarter or temporarily\\ndrops below half-time status for that term, and then resumes at least half-time enrollment in the spring, the school is not\\nrequired to make any changes to the original fall-winter-spring loan period. However, it may be necessary for the school\\nto adjust the originally approved loan amount if that amount is no longer supported by the reduced costs for the fall and\\nspring quarters only.\\nIn the first scenario described above the school could also choose to originate two separate loans for fall-only and spring-\\nonly loan periods. In the second scenario the school would also have the option of adjusting the original fall-winter-spring\\nloan period to fall-only, and then originating a new spring-only loan. Note, however, that in both cases the school would\\nthen be required to separately subtract the student9s full SAI from the fall-only and spring-only costs when determining\\nthe student9s Direct Subsidized Loan eligibility for those terms (see <No Alternate SAI When Originating Loans for Periods\\nOther Than Nine Months= earlier in this chapter). In some cases this could significantly reduce or even eliminate a\\nstudent9s need for Direct Subsidized Loans. In contrast, using a fall-winter-spring loan period (excluding all costs\\nassociated with the winter quarter) would allow the school to subtract the full SAI from the higher combined costs for the\\nfall and spring terms, partially mitigating the effect of not having alternate SAIs for periods of enrollment other than nine\\nmonths.\\nThe limited exception described above applies only if a student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan during the first and last\\nterms within the loan period. The term in which the student is ineligible cannot be the first or last term in the loan period.\\nFor instance, a school may not originate a loan for a fall-winter-spring loan period if the student does not attend the fall\\nterm or the spring term.\\nNote: See the guidance at the end of this chapter for certain exceptions to the normal loan period rules that apply when\\nperiods of clinical work are included in a standard term.\\nMinimum Loan Periods\\nThe minimum period for which a school may originate a Direct Loan varies depending on the school9s academic calendar.\\nAs explained below and in Chapter 7, different rules apply for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a\\nDirect Loan and the type of academic year that a school may use to monitor Direct Loan annual loan limits depending on\\nwhether a program is term-based (including subscription-based programs; see Volume 3, Chapter 1) with either standard\\nor nonstandard terms, or is a non-term program (all clock-hour programs are treated as non-term programs), and in the\\ncase of a term-based program with nonstandard terms, depending on the type of nonstandard term, as described below.\\nNonstandard terms may be one of the following types:\\n1. \\nNonstandard terms that are substantially equal (no term in the academic year differs in length from any\\nother term by more than two weeks), and each of the terms is at least nine weeks in length.\\nSE9W\\nPeriod of Enrollment (Loan Period) Definition\\n34 CFR 685.102(b)'),\n",

However, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms are\\ntreated the same as non-term programs for these purposes.\\nNote that substantially equal nonstandard terms (the first two types of nonstandard terms described above) are treated\\ndifferently for purposes of determining Direct Loan payment periods than for determining minimum loan period length\\nand monitoring annual loan limits. As explained in Volume 1, Chapter 1, if a program is offered in standard terms or in\\nnonstandard terms that are substantially equal in length (regardless of the length of the nonstandard term), the payment\\nperiod is the term.\\nHowever, for purposes of determining the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan and monitoring Direct Loan annual loan\\nlimits, substantially equal nonstandard terms that contain fewer than nine weeks are treated the same as nonstandard\\nterms that are not substantially equal. This means that if a program has substantially equal nonstandard terms that are\\nless than nine weeks in length, you must make a Direct Loan disbursement each term (the same as would be the case if\\nthe program were offered in standard terms), but the minimum loan period and the type of academic year used to\\nmonitor Direct Loan annual loan limits must be determined in accordance with the rules that apply to non-term programs.\\nFor detailed information on standard term, nonstandard term, and non-term programs, see Volume 1, Chapter 1.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Standard Term and SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\\nFor credit-hour programs with standard terms (semesters, quarters, or trimesters), or with SE9W\\nnonstandard terms, the minimum loan period is a single academic term. For example, if a student will be enrolled in the\\nfall semester only and will skip the spring semester, you may originate a loan with a loan period that covers only the fall\\nterm.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Clock-Hour, Non-Term, and Non-SE9W Nonstandard Term Programs\\nFor all other programs (i.e., clock-hour, non-term, and non-SE9W nonstandard term programs), the minimum\\nloan period is generally the lesser of the program length (or remainder of the program, if there is less than full academic\\nyear remaining) or the academic year. There are exceptions to this minimum loan period rule when originating loans for\\ntransfer students, or for students who complete or otherwise cease enrollment in one program and then begin a different\\nprogram at the same school. We discuss these exceptions in detail in Chapter 7 of this volume.\\nMinimum Loan Period: Programs Offered in Modules\\nIf a program is offered in modules, this does not change the minimum loan period rules for Direct Loans. For example, if a\\nstandard or SE9W nonstandard term is divided into two or more modules, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is\\nstill the term, even if the student does not attend all modules within the term.

In such cases, the minimum loan period for a Direct Loan is different\\ndepending on whether a student attends the intersession. If a student who attends the intersession requests a loan for the\\ncombined term, the loan period includes the standard term plus the intersession. However, if the student attends only the\\nstandard term and is not enrolled in the intersession that is attached to that term, the loan period includes only the\\nstandard term.\\nMaximum Loan Periods\\nThe maximum period for which you may originate a Direct Loan is generally an academic year. However, if your school\\napplies the annual loan limit for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans to a period of time greater than\\nan academic year, you may originate a Direct Loan for that longer period of time. For example, a school might offer an\\n1100 clock-hour program and define the academic year as 900 clock hours but could choose to allow students to receive\\njust one annual loan limit for the entire 1100-hour program. In that case, the loan period would correspond to the length\\nof the program, a period of time that is longer than the academic year.\\nDirect Loan Disbursement Requirements\\nFor general guidance on the timing of disbursements made under the Title IV programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1.

The following requirements apply for the timing of the\\nsecond disbursement:\\nFor credit-hour programs offered in standard terms or offered in nonstandard terms that are substantially equal in\\nlength with no term less than nine weeks of instructional time in length, the second disbursement may not be made\\nuntil the calendar midpoint between the first and last scheduled days of class in the loan period.\\nFor all other programs, including clock-hour and non-term credit-hour programs, and nonstandard term programs\\nwith terms that are not substantially equal or with terms that are substantially equal and less than nine weeks of\\ninstructional time in length, the second disbursement may not be made until the student successfully completes half\\nof the weeks of instructional time in the payment period, and half of the clock or credit hours in the payment period.\\nExceptions to the Multiple Disbursement Requirement When the Loan Period is a Single Payment Period\\nIf the loan period is not more than one semester, one trimester, one quarter or, for non-term-based schools or schools\\nwith nonstandard terms, four months, a school with a cohort default rate of less than 15% for each of the three most\\nrecent fiscal years for which data are available may disburse a Direct Loan in a single installment.\\nIn addition, if the loan period is a single payment period and more than half of the payment period has elapsed before the\\nschool has made a disbursement, the school may include in the disbursement loan proceeds for the entire payment\\nperiod.\\nException to the Multiple Disbursement Requirement for Study Abroad Programs\\nSubstantially Equal Disbursements\\n34 CFR 685.303(d)(5)\\nRegulatory Citations\\nLoan period is more than one payment period: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(3)(i)\\nLoan period is one payment period: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(3)(ii)\\nException based on cohort default rate: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(6)(i)(A)\\nMore than half of payment period has elapsed: 34 CFR 685.303(d)(4)(ii)'),\n",

Therefore, when creating a loan origination record\\nfor a Direct Loan when you intend to include in a disbursement loan proceeds for any payment periods that have been\\ncompleted, you should enter the actual date you anticipate making the disbursement as the anticipated date for all\\ndisbursements that would be included.

Direct Loan funds cannot be disbursed when there is no\\npossibility of repayment. In addition, if a school is not informed of a student or parent borrower9s death until after one or\\nmore loan disbursements have been made, the school must return to the Department the full amount of all loan funds\\nthat were credited to the student9s school account after the date of the borrower9s death (if the post-death disbursement\\ncreated a credit balance that was paid directly to the student or parent, the school is not responsible for returning the\\ncredit balance amount).\\nDisbursements after the date of the borrower9s death are most likely to occur when a parent Direct PLUS Loan borrower\\ndies.

If a standard term or SE9W nonstandard term contains clinical work that meets all the criteria\\nto be included in the term, this may result in certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement rules as\\ndiscussed earlier in this chapter. We discuss these exceptions below.\\nIf clinical work meets the criteria described in Volume 3 to be included in a standard term or SE9W nonstandard\\nterm, the school must associate the clinical work with the term during which the majority of the clinical work occurs.\\nIf a student receives a Direct Loan for a term that includes clinical work and the clinical work begins before the\\nstarting date of the term with which the clinical work is associated, the loan period start date is the beginning date of\\nthe clinical work (rather than the starting date of the term, as would normally be the case).\\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters that run from September 1 through May 31, and the fall semester includes clinical work that begins on\\nAugust 15, the school would report the loan period dates as August 15 through May 31. If the clinical work does not\\nbegin until on or after the starting date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period start date would be\\nthe beginning date of the term.\\nIf the clinical work ends after the ending date of the term with which it is associated, the loan period end date for a\\nDirect Loan is the ending date of the clinical work (instead of the ending date of the term, as would normally be the\\ncase).\\nFor example, if a school originates a Direct Loan for a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters that run from September 1 through December 31 (fall) and January 1 through May 31 (spring), and the\\nspring semester includes clinical work that ends on June 20, the school would report the loan period dates as\\nSeptember 1 through June 20. However, if the clinical work ends on or before the ending date of the term with which\\nit is associated, the loan period end date would be the ending date of the term.\\nIf loan period dates are adjusted as explained above to account for clinical work that begins before or ends after the\\nnormal term starting and ending dates, the academic year period to which the Direct Loan annual loan limit applies,\\nand the payment period dates must also be adjusted accordingly. Using the example above where the spring term of\\na fall-spring SAY contains clinical work that ends on June 20, and assuming that the annual loan limit applies to that\\nfall-spring SAY period, the school would report the academic year dates associated with the loan as September 1\\nthrough June 20, and would report the dates of the second payment period (the spring semester) as January 1\\nthrough June 20 (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on payment periods, and Chapter 6 of this volume for\\ninformation on SAYs and monitoring annual loan limits).\\nIf there are two consecutive loan periods for standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms that include clinical work,\\nand the first loan period has not ended when the clinical work associated with the next loan period is scheduled to\\nbegin (because the clinical work associated with the term has not yet been completed), it is permissible for the two\\nloan periods (and the associated payment periods) to overlap.'),\n",

Because Direct PLUS Loans can be made for up to the full COA minus other financial\\nassistance received, the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount may not be sufficient to substitute entirely for the\\namount a parent could receive under the Direct PLUS Loan program. Therefore, you should determine whether the\\nparents may be able to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan by obtaining an endorser who does not have an adverse credit history\\nbefore originating additional unsubsidized loan amounts for the dependent student. Before a dependent student can\\nreceive the additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount, you must document the basis of the student9s eligibility. Some\\nbasic guidelines for making this determination are discussed below. However, keep in mind that none of the following, by\\nthemselves, are sufficient to make a dependent student eligible for additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds:\\nThe parent9s unwillingness to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan (even though the parent would otherwise be eligible to\\nborrow);\\nThe school9s decision not to participate in the Direct PLUS Loan program; or\\nThe financial aid administrator9s belief that the parent should not borrow a Direct PLUS Loan.\\nGeneral Guidelines for Determining That a Dependent Student May Receive Additional Unsubsidized Funds\\nThe sections that follow provide general guidelines for making a determination that a dependent student is eligible to\\nreceive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds under various circumstances.\\nOnly One Parent Has Applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and Been Denied\\nIf only one of a student9s parents has applied for a Direct PLUS Loan and been denied based on adverse credit, you may\\naward additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds on that basis, without first determining whether there is another parent\\nwho could take out a Direct PLUS Loan. However, if both parents apply independently and one is approved and the other\\ndenied, the dependent student is not eligible for the additional unsubsidized loan amounts.\\nA Previously Approved Parent Later Requests Additional Direct PLUS Loan Funds and Is Denied\\nThe dependent student may become eligible at any time during an academic year if a parent has first been approved and\\nthen later denied a Direct PLUS Loan. For example, if a parent was approved for and received the full amount of a Direct\\nPLUS Loan for a fall-spring loan period, but the parent is subsequently determined ineligible due to having an adverse\\ncredit history when they request additional Direct PLUS Loan funds later during the spring semester, you may award\\nIncreased Direct Unsubsidized Loan Eligibility for Independent Undergraduates and Certain\\nDependent Undergraduates\\n34 CFR 685.203(c)'),\n",

For instance, if your school accepts 30 semester hours of a student9s work in a previous baccalaureate program\\ntoward the requirements for a BS in Chemistry at your school and, on that basis, classifies the student at the second-year\\nlevel, then the student would be eligible for second-year undergraduate loan limits (see <Loan Limit When a\\nBaccalaureate or Associate Degree Is Required for Admission to an Undergraduate Program= earlier in this chapter for the\\nloan limit that applies when a student is required to have a prior associate or baccalaureate degree as a condition for\\nbeing admitted to an undergraduate program).\\nStudents Who Transfer From a Graduate Program to an Undergraduate Program During an Academic Year\\nIf a student transfers from a graduate program to an undergraduate program in the middle of an academic year, the\\nundergraduate annual loan limit for the student9s grade level applies but amounts previously borrowed at the graduate\\nlevel within the same academic year do not count against the undergraduate annual loan limit. However, the total amount\\nawarded for the academic year may not exceed the higher (graduate or professional) annual loan limit.\\nVolume 8, Chapter 4, Example 1: Transfer From a Graduate to Undergraduate Program During the Same Academic\\nYear\\nA student who received $10,250 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds for a fall semester loan as a graduate student\\nenrolls in an undergraduate program at the same school in the spring semester of the school9s fall-spring\\nacademic year and is classified as a third-year independent undergraduate.

However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\\nTitle IV programs.)\\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower\\nalso include the outstanding portion of consolidation loans (both Direct Consolidation Loans and Federal Consolidation\\nLoans made under the FFEL program) attributable to Direct Subsidized Loans, Direct Unsubsidized Loans, Subsidized\\nFederal Stafford Loans, and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans that were repaid by the consolidation loan.\\nUnallocated Consolidation Loan Amounts\\nNSLDS may also show a <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount that is not counted against a borrower9s aggregate\\nloan limits. The <Consolidation Loans, Unallocated= amount represents the portion of a consolidation loan that cannot be\\nattributed to other loans in the borrower9s loan history. For example, it may represent capitalized interest or non-Title IV\\nloans that were consolidated.

Loan limits are not prorated based on a student9s enrollment status, such as when a student is\\nenrolled less than full time, or when a student is enrolled for a period of less than a full academic year that is not a\\nremaining period of study.\\nThe annual loan limit for Direct Unsubsidized Loans is not prorated for students enrolled in graduate or professional level\\nprograms. Loan proration requirements also do not apply to students taking preparatory coursework or coursework\\nnecessary for teacher certification. This is because the annual loan limit must be prorated only when a student is enrolled\\nin a program or remaining portion of a program that is shorter than an academic year. Students taking preparatory\\ncoursework or teacher certification coursework are not considered to be enrolled in a program for purposes of awarding\\nTitle IV aid.\\nIt9s important to understand that loan limit proration determines the maximum loan amount that a student may borrow\\nfor a program or remaining balance of a program, not the actual loan amount a student is eligible to receive. In some\\ncases, the loan amount a student is eligible to receive (based on costs, SAI, and OFA) may be less than the prorated loan\\nlimit.\\nUse of Fractions vs. Decimals When Prorating Loan Limits\\nAs we explain in more detail below, proration involves multiplying the annual loan limit by a fraction. You may choose to\\nconvert the fraction to a decimal and then multiply the annual loan limit by the decimal, but this conversion is not a\\nrequirement. However, you should be consistent in the method you use, since the fraction and decimal calculations\\nsometimes result in slightly different prorated loan limits, as shown in the examples later in the chapter.\\nUsing the School9s Academic Year Definition If Longer Than the Title IV Minimum\\nAs explained above, proration of the annual loan limit is required when an undergraduate student is enrolled in a program\\nthat is shorter than an academic year or is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic year.\\nA school may choose to define its academic year as longer in weeks or hours than the minimum statutory requirements. If\\nso, the school9s standard 3 not the statutory minimum 3 determines whether a program or a final period of study is shorter\\nthan an academic year.\\nSeparate Calculations for the Combined Subsidized and Unsubsidized Annual Loan Limit and the Maximum Subsidized\\nLoan Limit Proration\\n34 CFR 685.203(a), (b), (c)'),\n",

For programs that are offered in a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY; see\\nChapter 6), the number of terms covered in the school9s Title IV academic year usually does not include a summer\\n<header= or <trailer= term.\\nConsider a student who is enrolled in a four-year program that is offered in an SAY consisting of three quarters plus a\\nsummer trailer, and who has completed four academic years of study. The student needs to attend an additional quarter\\nterm to complete the program requirements. The final quarter term falls in a new academic year; therefore the annual\\nloan limit must be prorated because the remaining period of study (a single quarter) is less than a full academic year.\\nSimilarly, if a student enrolled in a two-year program not offered in an SAY (where the Title IV academic year covers two\\n15-week semesters) has completed two academic years of study, but needs to return for an additional semester to\\ncomplete the program requirements, the loan limit must be prorated if the student receives a loan for the final semester.\\nNote that for standard-term programs or credit-hour programs with SE9W nonstandard terms, the length of the loan\\nperiod does not determine whether a student is enrolled in a remaining period of study that is shorter than an academic\\nyear. The determining factor is the length of the remaining period of study in which the student is enrolled, which may not\\nbe the same as the loan period. For example, if an undergraduate student is enrolled for a full SAY consisting of fall and\\nspring semesters, and will complete the program at the end of the spring term, but is enrolled less than half time during\\nthe spring, the student is eligible to receive a Direct Loan only for the fall semester. Although the loan period (fall only) is\\nshorter than an academic year, the remaining period of study (fall through spring) is a full academic year. Therefore, if the\\nstudent receives a Direct Loan in the fall, proration of the annual loan limit is not required.\\nIn a clock-hour program, non-term program, or a program with non-SE9W nonstandard terms, a remaining\\nperiod of study is considered less than an academic year if it consists of fewer clock or credit hours than the program9s\\ndefined Title IV academic year. In contrast to standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, if a student enrolled\\nin a clock-hour, non-term, or non-SE9W nonstandard term program is in a remaining period of study shorter than an\\nacademic year and receives a Direct Loan, the loan period and the remaining period of study will always be the same. This\\nis because for these programs the minimum loan period is the lesser of the length of the program (or remaining portion of\\na program) or the academic year.\\nFor all types of programs, you determine the prorated loan limit for a student enrolled in a remaining period of study less\\nthan an academic year by multiplying the applicable annual loan limit by the following fraction:\\nUnlike proration for programs that are shorter than an academic year, there is no comparison of weeks and hours.

That is, a\\nstudent may receive up to the applicable annual loan limit each academic year (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for guidance on\\ndefining the academic year). Note that the loan period for which a Direct Loan is originated does not always correspond to\\nthe academic year. Although the loan period is often the same as the academic year, it may also be for a period shorter\\nthan the academic year.\\nFor Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans, a school must use either a Scheduled Academic Year (SAY) or\\na Borrower-Based Academic Year (BBAY) to determine when a student is eligible for a new annual loan limit. Although\\nthere is no fixed annual loan limit for Direct PLUS Loans, Direct PLUS Loans are awarded for the same SAY or BBAY period\\nthat is used for Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans. The type of academic year (SAY or BBAY) that a\\nschool may (or must) use to monitor annual loan limit progression depends on a program9s academic calendar, as\\nexplained in the sections that follow.\\nScheduled Academic Year\\nAn SAY corresponds to a traditional academic year calendar that is published in a school9s catalog or other materials and\\nis a fixed period of time that generally begins and ends at the same time each year. An SAY may be used by:\\nPrograms with standard terms and a traditional academic calendar; or\\nPrograms with SE9W nonstandard terms (see Chapter 3) and a comparable calendar.\\nThe guidance above also applies to subscription-based programs with standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms. For\\nmore information on academic calendars for subscription-based programs, see Volume 3, Chapter 1.\\nExamples of SAYs for a standard term program are fall and spring semesters, or fall, winter, and spring quarters. If a\\nprogram has SE9W nonstandard terms, an SAY could consist of two or more SE9W nonstandard terms running from fall\\nthrough spring. For both standard term and SE9W nonstandard term programs, the number of credit hours and weeks of\\ninstructional time in the fall through spring SAY period must meet the regulatory requirements for an academic year.\\nSAY for Programs With Standard Terms Using a Traditional Academic Calendar\\nAs noted previously, an SAY corresponds to a traditional academic year calendar and usually begins and ends at the same\\ntime each calendar year (for example, beginning on the first day of the fall semester and ending on the last day of the\\nspring semester). An SAY must meet the Title IV requirements for an academic year (as defined in Volume 3, Chapter 1).\\nAn SAY may include one or more terms that a student does not attend.\\nStandard terms are semesters, trimesters, or quarters (see Volume 3, Chapter 1 for more detail on standard terms). A\\nstandard-term program may use an SAY if it has a traditional academic calendar (i.e., has terms that start and end at\\nabout the same time each year, such as an academic calendar consisting of the fall and spring semesters or the fall,\\nwinter, and spring quarters).\\nSummer terms are generally not considered to be part of the SAY, but for purposes of monitoring loan limits they may be\\ntreated as a <trailer= to the preceding SAY or as a <header= to the following SAY. Your school has the option to establish a\\npolicy that designates its summer term as either a trailer or header to the SAY for all students. You can also choose to\\nmake different designations for different educational programs, or for different students, as long as you ensure that there\\nis no overlap in academic years. Note that a fixed designation of the summer term as either a trailer or header can limit a\\nstudent9s eligibility. For instance, if you always treat your summer term as a trailer to a preceding fall-spring SAY, a\\nstudent who receives the full annual loan limit for fall-spring would have no remaining loan eligibility for summer.\\nIf the summer term is split into modules (sometimes called <minisessions=), such as <summer 1= and <summer 2,= the\\nmodules can be combined and treated as a single trailer or header, or they can be treated separately and assigned to\\ndifferent SAYs. That is, the first module can be treated as a trailer to the preceding fall-spring SAY, and the second module'),\n",

There are three types of BBAY:\\nBBAY 1, for credit-hour programs using an SAY with standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms (including\\nsubscription-based programs, as described in Volume 3, Chapter 1).\\nBBAY 2, for credit-hour programs not using an SAY, with standard terms or SE9W nonstandard terms (including\\nsubscription-based programs, as described in Volume 3, Chapter 1).\\nBBAY 3, for clock-hour programs, non-term programs, programs with non-SE9W nonstandard terms (see Chapter 4\\nof this volume), or programs with standard and nonstandard terms not described above.\\nIf a program is offered in an SAY calendar, you have the option of using either an SAY or BBAY 1 to monitor the annual\\nloan limits for students in that program. You must use a BBAY to monitor the annual loan limits for any academic program\\nthat does not meet the definition of a program allowed to use an SAY. However, there are significant differences between\\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 1: SE9W SAY\\nA school has programs with an academic calendar using semester hours with three 12-week quarters, offered\\nover the fall through spring (comparable to a traditional academic year calendar) and a 10-week term offered in\\nthe summer. The school defines the academic year for these programs as 36 weeks of instructional time and 24\\nsemester hours. Because the terms are quarters, but academic progress is measured in semester hours, the\\nterms are considered nonstandard.\\nBecause these terms are SE9W nonstandard terms offered in a fixed schedule with an academic calendar\\ncomparable to a traditional calendar, the school may use an SAY (with the summer term treated as a trailer or\\nheader) or BBAY 1 consisting of any three consecutive terms (see below) for these programs.'),\n",

We describe the differences between BBAY 1, BBAY 2, and BBAY 3 in the sections that follow.\\nBBAY 1 for Credit-Hour Programs With an SAY\\nIf a program is offered in an SAY, you have the option of using a BBAY 1 as an alternative to the SAY for monitoring annual\\nloan limit progression. As explained earlier, a BBAY is not a fixed period that begins and ends at the same time each year.\\nThe beginning and ending dates depend on the individual student9s enrollment.\\nFor programs with an SAY, a BBAY 1 must include the same number of terms as the SAY that would otherwise be used\\n(not counting any summer trailer or header). For example, if the SAY includes three quarters (fall, winter, spring), a BBAY\\n1 would consist of any three consecutive terms. A BBAY 1 may include terms the student does not attend if the student\\ncould have enrolled at least half time in those terms, but (unlike an SAY) it must begin with a term in which the student\\nis enrolled (even though the student may be enrolled less than half time for the first term and not eligible for a loan for\\nthat term). Also, any modules (summer or otherwise) that run consecutively within a term must be combined and treated\\nas a single term. The COA cannot include costs for a module for which the student is not expected to be enrolled. A\\nstudent doesn9t have to be enrolled in each module but must be able to enroll at least half time in the combined term.\\nLike an SAY, a BBAY 1 must meet the minimum Title IV requirements for an academic year. However, a BBAY 1 that\\nincludes a summer term may include fewer than 30 weeks of instructional time or fewer credit hours than the minimum\\nnumber required for an SAY. This is because a summer term may be shorter than a standard term in an SAY but is\\nrecognized as academically equivalent to a standard term when used as one of the terms in a BBAY 1. This exception\\napplies only to a BBAY 1 used as an alternative for a program with an SAY.\\nYou may use a BBAY 1 for all students, only for students in certain programs, or on a student-by-student basis. For\\nexample, you could use a BBAY 1 for students enrolled in a program that begins in a term other than the first term of the\\nSAY. You can even alternate BBAY 1 and SAY for a student, provided the academic years don9t overlap. This treatment\\nmay allow a student to receive another loan sooner than would be allowed under an SAY standard.\\nAs with an SAY, the annual loan limit applies to the BBAY 1. Once the calendar period associated with all terms in the\\nBBAY 1 has elapsed, a student regains eligibility for a new annual loan limit.\\nAlternating an SAY With BBAY 1\\nAlternating an SAY with BBAY 1 may allow a student to receive another loan sooner than would be allowed with an SAY.\\nFor instance, if you normally use an SAY consisting of fall and spring semesters with a summer trailer, a student who\\nreceived the maximum annual loan limit for fall-spring could not receive another loan until the start of a new SAY in the\\nfall. If the student enrolls for summer and wants a loan, you could choose to switch the student to a BBAY 1 consisting of\\nthe summer and fall terms. The student could then receive a loan for the summer term, which would be the start of a new\\nacademic year. A school that provides flexibility in academic year standards for purposes of monitoring annual loan limits\\nmust have a written policy that explains how it applies this flexibility when determining loan eligibility.\\nExamples 2 through 5 illustrate the optional use of BBAY 1 for a program that is offered in an SAY. Note that in each\\nexample the first BBAY 1 is the same as the SAY.\\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 2: BBAY 1 Where the SAY Contains Two Semesters\\nYear 1: SAY or BBAY 1\\nYear 2: BBAY 1\\nYear 3: BBAY 1\\nFall + Spring\\nSummer + Fall\\nSpring + Summer\\nIn Example 2, the initial fall and spring terms could be considered either an SAY or BBAY 1. If the student attends\\nthe summer session at the school, the school can choose to treat the summer term and the next fall as a BBAY 1\\nfor the student. In that case, the following spring and summer would also constitute a BBAY 1. The maximum loan\\nlimit for an academic year applies to each BBAY 1.

For example, a student who is attending less than full time will take longer\\nto complete a BBAY 3 than a full-time student.

However, one student might complete 900\\nclock hours in 22 weeks, and another in 30 weeks.\\nAs we explained in Chapter 5 of this volume, the annual loan limit must be prorated (reduced) if an undergraduate\\nstudent is enrolled in a program that is less than a full academic year in length or is in a remaining period of study that is\\nshorter than a full academic year. However, in the scenario described above, you do not have to prorate the loan limit for\\nthe occasional student who completes the program in fewer than 26 weeks. This policy applies only to programs that are\\nexactly one academic year in length. If a program is longer than an academic year, proration may be required for a loan\\ncovering the remaining portion of the program if a student completes more than the minimum number of hours during the\\nfirst 26 weeks of instructional time (see Example 7 in Chapter 5 of this volume).\\nBBAY 3 for Programs With Both Standard and Nonstandard Terms\\nBBAY 3 must also be used if a program has both standard terms and nonstandard terms and does not qualify to use an\\nSAY. For example, if you offer a program with a 4-week intersession between a 15-week fall semester and a 15-week\\nspring semester, and you do not combine the intersession with one of the standard terms but instead treat it as a\\nstandalone nonstandard term, you must use BBAY 3 to monitor annual loan limit progression. In this circumstance you\\ncannot simply ignore the intersession and consider the program to be offered only in standard terms. In contrast, if you\\ncombine the intersession with one of the semesters, you could use an SAY consisting of the fall and spring semesters.\\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 7: BBAY 3 for a Clock-Hour Program\\nA school has an 1,800 clock-hour program with 52 weeks of instructional time and defines its academic year as\\n900 clock hours and 26 weeks of instructional time. The first BBAY 3 begins with a student9s initial enrollment\\ndate and ends when the student has successfully completed the first 900 clock hours and 26 weeks of\\ninstructional time in the program, whichever comes later.\\nThe second BBAY 3 would be the period of time it takes the student to successfully complete the final 900 hours\\nand 26 weeks of instructional time in the program. A student who completes the first 900 hours in less than 26\\nweeks must still complete 26 weeks of instructional time before the second BBAY 3 begins. Similarly, a student\\nwho has completed fewer than 900 clock hours after 26 weeks of instructional time must successfully complete\\n900 hours before the second BBAY 3 begins.\\nDuring the first BBAY 3, the student may receive up to the full annual loan limit for a first-year undergraduate.\\nThe student becomes eligible for a new annual loan limit (at the second-year undergraduate level) when the\\nsecond BBAY 3 begins.\\nThe principles described in this example for a clock-hour program also apply to non-term credit-hour programs or\\nnon-SE9W nonstandard term credit-hour programs. For example, if a school offers a non-term 48 semester hour,\\n60 weeks of instructional time program with a defined academic year of 24 semester hours and 30 weeks of\\ninstructional time, the second BBAY 3 would not begin until a student has successfully completed the first 24\\nsemester hours and 30 weeks of instructional time.\\nSimilarly, in a 72 quarter-hour program with 60 weeks of instructional time offered in a series of non-SE9W\\nnonstandard terms, with a defined academic year of 36 quarter hours and 30 weeks of instructional time, the\\nsecond BBAY 3 would not begin until a student has successfully completed the first 36 quarter hours and 30\\nweeks of instructional time, whichever comes later, regardless of the number of terms that have elapsed.

(See Volume 3, Chapter 1 for a discussion of academic year requirements.)\\nIncreasing the Loan Amount When a Student9s Grade Level Changes During an Academic Year\\nThere are two options for awarding an additional loan amount when a student progresses to a grade level with a higher\\nannual loan limit during an academic year:\\n1. Originate a new loan at the new grade level for the difference between the new loan limit and the amount of the first\\nloan. The loan period for the new loan must correspond to the term(s) during which the student qualifies for the\\nhigher loan limit. You could also choose to cancel any pending disbursements of the first loan and originate a new\\nloan for an amount equal to the canceled disbursements of the first loan plus the additional amount for which the\\nstudent is eligible due to the grade level change.\\n2. Adjust the amount of the current loan. Change the grade level in the loan record and increase the amount of the\\nexisting loan to the new amount.\\nWith either option, the student9s remaining loan eligibility must be calculated using only the COA and OFA for the term(s)\\nduring which the student qualifies for the higher loan limit.\\nAs a reminder, a student can progress to a higher grade level during an academic year only in a program with standard\\nterms or SE9W nonstandard terms.\\nVolume 8, Chapter 6, Example 8: Grade-Level Progression Within the Same SAY\\nA dependent second-year undergraduate student qualifies for the maximum annual combined subsidized and\\nunsubsidized annual loan limit of $6,500, not more than $4,500 of which may be subsidized. For purposes of this\\nexample, assume that the student is eligible to receive the maximum $4,500 in Direct Subsidized Loan funds and\\nthe remaining $2,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. The student receives a first disbursement of $2,250 in\\nDirect Subsidized Loan funds and $1,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds at the beginning of the fall semester\\nof a fall-spring SAY.\\nBased on the coursework completed during the fall semester, the student progresses to third-year academic\\nstatus at the beginning of the spring semester. The student now qualifies for the $7,500 combined subsidized and\\nunsubsidized annual limit (maximum $5,500 subsidized) that applies to third-year and beyond dependent\\nundergraduates. If otherwise eligible, for the spring term the student could receive up to the difference between\\nthe amount already received in the fall and the new annual limit in the spring term. If the student again qualifies\\nfor the maximum subsidized loan amount, eligibility for the spring term is as follows:\\n$5,500 - $2,250 subsidized received in the fall = $3,250 subsidized eligibility for spring; and\\n$2,000 - $1,000 unsubsidized received in the fall = $1,000 additional unsubsidized eligibility for spring.\\nHowever, only the COA and OFA associated with the spring term can be used in determining the student9s\\neligibility for the additional loan amount in that term. The COA and OFA for the fall term cannot be considered.\\nThe school may either originate a new spring-only subsidized loan for the additional subsidized loan eligibility in\\nthe spring term (note that the grade level progression does not increase the student9s additional unsubsidized\\neligibility) or may increase the amount of the original fall-spring subsidized loan and make the appropriate\\nadjustment to the second disbursement of that loan.'),\n",

The student requests a loan for\\nthe fall and spring semesters (September-May). The program at School B uses an SAY consisting of fall and spring\\nsemesters, followed by a summer trailer term.\\nBecause the academic year at School B begins before the end of the academic year at School A, the student may\\ninitially receive only up to a maximum of $4,500 for the fall semester at School B, not more than $2,500 of which\\nmay be subsidized. This amount represents the difference between the annual loan limit of $6,500 (maximum\\n$4,500 subsidized), and the amount received at School A ($2,000 subsidized) for the overlapping academic year\\nperiod.\\nThe initial loan period at School B corresponds with the fall term. If the student receives the maximum of $4,500\\nfor the fall semester, at the start of the spring semester in January the student may borrow up to an additional\\n$2,000 (the difference between the second-year dependent undergraduate annual loan limit and the amount\\nalready borrowed for the fall-spring academic year at School B). If the student received the maximum $2,500 in\\nsubsidized loan funds for the fall term, the additional $2,000 would be limited to unsubsidized loan funds.\\nAs an alternative, School B could choose to change the student from an SAY schedule to a BBAY 1 schedule\\nbeginning with the spring semester.

If a student9s FAFSA Submission Summary/ISIR contains a comment code that requires resolution, the\\nunderlying issue must be resolved before any Title IV funds may be disbursed to the student. For instance, if an applicant\\nhas defaulted on a federal student loan, the FAFSA Submission Summary and ISIR will note this in several places,\\nincluding comments to the applicant and the NSLDS financial aid history page.

While the chapter follows the organization of the paper (PDF) FAFSA form\\nand the ISIR, the guidance applies equally to the online FAFSA. To see how FAFSA data are used to calculate the Student\\nAid Index (SAI), refer to Chapter 3.\\nThe easiest, fastest, and most accurate way to complete a FAFSA form is using the online application and providing\\nconsent and approval for the access, disclosure, and use of federal tax information (FTI). The online FAFSA form provides\\nrobust instructions for completing the form. It also provides a clear path for the student and each contributor, allowing\\nthem to skip (or never see) questions that are unnecessary, irrelevant, or already known based on information previously\\nprovided or imported. However, some applicants will be unable or unwilling to complete the FAFSA form online and have\\nthe option to complete a paper version of the form.\\nFUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\\nThe FUTURE Act amended Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to allow the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to\\ndisclose certain FTI to FSA. The IRS and FSA worked together to develop the FUTURE Act Direct Data Exchange (FA-DDX)\\nwhich established a secure connection between both agencies through an application programming interface that\\nprocesses requests in near-real time. The FA-DDX replaced the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS-DRT) to import certain FTI into\\nan applicant9s FAFSA form.\\nConsent and Approval\\nThe student and each contributor to the FAFSA form must provide consent and approval to the access, disclosure, and use\\nof FTI in evaluating the applicant9s eligibility for Title IV aid. Consent and approval are required regardless of the\\napplication method (online or paper).\\nTo provide consent and approval, FAFSA contributors (including parent(s) or spouse) must agree to:\\n1. The Department9s use and disclosure of their information (e.g., name and Social Security number) to match with the\\nIRS;\\nDefinitions\\nFAFSA Privacy Act Consent 3 Formal consent provided by an applicant and any applicable contributor(s) for a\\ngiven FAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) that meets the\\nstatutory requirements of collecting and using an individual9s personally-identifiable information (PII) under the\\nPrivacy Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 552a). PII provided on the FAFSA form (e.g., name, date of birth, Social\\nSecurity number) with consent of the individual, will be provided to the IRS to conduct a match for the\\nDepartment to receive FTI for purposes of determining an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility and permit\\nfurther redisclosure of FTI by the Department.\\nFAFSA FTI Approval 3 Formal approval granted by an applicant and any applicable contributors for a given\\nFAFSA cycle (e.g., December 2024 to September 2026 for the 2025-26 FAFSA form) to retrieve and use FTI to\\ndetermine an applicant9s federal financial aid eligibility as well as permit the redisclosure of FTI by the\\nDepartment to an eligible institution; state higher education agency; or a designated scholarship organization for\\nthe application, award, and administration of student aid programs. An applicant and contributor (if applicable)\\nmust provide approval once each year. If FAFSA FTI approval is not provided, the student will not be eligible for\\nany Title IV aid until the approval is provided by each contributor.'),\n",

The redisclosure of FTI by the Department to an eligible institution, state higher education agency, or a designated\\nscholarship organization (e.g., institutional or state financial aid).\\nOnly the Department has the authority to obtain approval and consent for the use and disclosure of FTI for such purposes.\\nOur partners (FAAs, advocates, etc.) are not permitted to obtain approval and consent on behalf of FAFSA contributors\\n(including parent(s) or spouse) for the use and disclosure of FTI.\\nOnce a FAFSA contributor has provided consent and approval for use and disclosure of FTI for a FAFSA cycle (e.g., the\\n2025-26 FAFSA cycle), they cannot revoke consent for that cycle. The ability to revoke consent is not needed for FAFSA\\npurposes because the FAFSA contributor is providing a one-time consent for a specific tax year and an annual consent is\\nrequired for each FAFSA cycle.\\nStudents and contributors are not able to view or edit the imported FTI data. This is to enhance security, privacy, and to\\nreduce the risk of the misuse of sensitive data. However, you (the financial aid administrator) will be able to see the\\ntransferred data on the ISIR. Schools and other partners that receive ISIRs must protect federal student aid information\\nprovided to them by the Department or otherwise obtained in support of the application, award, and administration of the\\nfederal student aid programs as permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA, as amended. In keeping with the\\nexpectation that you protect the confidentiality of data associated with the Title IV programs, you must not disclose FTI\\nfrom the FAFSA form unless the disclosure and use is permitted under the IRC 6103(l)(13) and HEA 1098h. For additional\\ninformation and guidance on the use of FTI, see Electronic Announcement GENERAL-23-34.\\nSignatures\\nEach student and required contributor must both (1) provide consent and approval to obtain tax information from the IRS\\nand (2) sign the FAFSA application. While both the student and contributors must provide consent and approval once per\\napplication cycle, a signature may be required multiple times throughout the cycle if a student makes corrections to a\\nprocessed FAFSA form. In these cases, the student or the contributor must sign that correction to certify the information is\\naccurate but will not be prompted to provide consent and approval again. Therefore, it is possible for a FAFSA transaction\\nto contain consent and approval but not the required signature(s). If your school receives an ISIR transaction indicating\\nthat the transaction source (i.e. paper or online FAFSA) was unsigned, the applicant or contributor can return to their\\nFAFSA form and sign the correction. Alternatively, you can print a signature page in the FAFSA Partner Portal (FPP), collect\\nthe necessary original signature(s), and indicate in FPP that you have the signature on file. This will resolve the signature\\nrequirement but will not satisfy the requirement for consent and approval. Only the Department can collect a contributor9s\\nconsent and approval.\\nFederal Tax Information\\nThe following data received by the Department from the IRS are considered FTI:\\nTax Year (ex. Award year 2025-26 is based on 2023 tax year information from the IRS)\\nTax Filing Status\\nAdjusted Gross Income (AGI)\\nNumber of Exemptions and Number of Dependents\\nIncome Earned from Work\\nTaxes Paid\\nEducational Credits\\nUntaxed IRA distributions\\nIRA deductions and payments\\nTax exempt interest\\nUntaxed pension amounts\\nSchedule C net profit/loss'),\n",

If\\nthe student is living with a parent who is paying for most of the household expenses, the parent would usually be\\nconsidered the primary source of support to the student9s child, and the student should not indicate they have legal\\ndependents. However, there may be some cases where the student can demonstrate that they provide more than half of\\ntheir child9s support even while living at home with their parents, in which case the student could indicate they have legal\\ndependents.\\nIf the student receives money or other support for the legal dependent from sources other than their parents, the student\\nmay count it as part of their support to the child. Sources include government programs, such as Temporary Assistance\\nfor Needy Families (TANF) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), that provide benefits for dependent\\nchildren. So, a student may be considered independent when the benefit they receive is the primary support for the child.\\nHowever, child support received from a noncustodial parent cannot be counted as part of the student9s support to the\\nchild.\\nWhen a student completes a FAFSA form after the award year has begun and indicates they have a legal dependent who\\nis not the student9s child, the support already given by the student during the award year plus the future support for the\\nremainder of the award year must total more than 50% for the whole award year for the individual to meet the definition\\nof a legal dependent.\\nLegal Dependent Examples\\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 1: A student and their disabled sibling currently live together.

The sibling is considered a dependent of the student and can be\\nincluded in the student9s family size on the FAFSA form. The student is also an independent student due to having\\na legal dependent.\\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 2: The same student and disabled sibling currently live together and expect to\\ncontinue to do so through the award year.

The student pays\\n$1,500 per month to support their partner. The partner also has earned income of $2,000 per month and receives\\n$200 per month from their parents. The partner uses all of this for their support. The student cannot consider their\\npartner a legal dependent since the $1,500 they provide is not more than half of the partner9s total support of\\n$3,700.\\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 5: In April 2025, a student applies for aid for both 2024-25 and 2025-26 award years.\\nOne month prior to that, their parent moved in with the student. The parent is undocumented and does not work\\nor qualify to receive other federal benefits.

Therefore, the student cannot claim their parent as a legal dependent on their 2024-25\\nFAFSA form. If the parent had moved in before the midpoint of the year, the student would have been able to\\ncount the parent as a dependent for 2024-25. However, because the two plan to live together and the student\\nplans to provide more than 50% support at least through June 2026, the student can count the parent as a\\ndependent for 2025-26.\\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 6: A student lives alone with their infant child.

The student provides the remainder of the child9s support through\\npart-time work. The student can consider the child a legal dependent as they live together and the student\\nprovides more than 50% of the child9s support.\\nAVG, Chapter 2, Example 7: A student lives alone with their infant child. The child9s other parent shares\\ncustody of the child and pays $1,000 per month in child support to the student. The student receives the\\nequivalent of $500 per month from government assistance programs for the child. The student does not work and\\nrelies on the child support and government assistance to support the child. The student cannot consider the child\\na legal dependent, even though the child lives with the student, because the student does not provide more than\\n50% of the child9s support. If the student is not otherwise independent, the student will need to provide parent\\ninformation on the FAFSA form.

However, the value of a family9s primary residence is still excluded, even if the residence is on the farm\\nproperty or used to run the business. Applicants should determine the total net value of all farm assets and subtract the\\nnet value of their principal residence to determine the final value of their farm assets. The principal residence may include\\nthe family9s home, as well as structures and land adjacent to the home that are not being used, stored, or sold for farming\\nor other commercial activities. Property values are generally assessed at a rate that considers the use of the property and\\nthe value of the land. Applicants and their families may refer to their property tax assessments from municipal, county, or\\nstate governments to help determine and separate the value of their principal residence from other property.\\nQualified education benefits or education savings accounts include Coverdell savings accounts, 529 college\\nsavings plans, and the refund value of 529 prepaid tuition plans. For an independent student, the accounts owned by the\\nstudent (and/or the student9s spouse) are reported as student investments. For a dependent student, an account is\\nreported as a parental investment if the account is designated for the dependent student (accounts designated for other\\nchildren in the family are not included).

Therefore, if such interest is reported on a tax\\nreturn, it likely indicates an asset that should be reported on the FAFSA form: the value of the take-back mortgage. There\\nwould be no debt reported against this asset. For example, if an individual sold their house for $200,000 and financed a\\ntake back mortgage of $40,000 to the buyer, the seller should report $40,000 as the net worth of the investment. The\\nworth will decrease each year depending on how much of the principal the buyer paid back that year. This concept applies\\nto other forms of seller financing of the sale of a home or other property.\\nVirtual currency (or cryptocurrency) such as Bitcoin is considered an asset. The value (in U.S. dollars as of the day the\\nFAFSA form is completed) of virtual currency must be reported on the FAFSA form. If the owner sells virtual currency and\\nhas a capital gain from the sale, the taxable portion will be in the AGI for the year it is reported on the tax return, and the\\nAGI will then be included on the associated FAFSA form. For more information on how the IRS treats virtual currencies,\\nplease see the IRS virtual currency webpage.\\nUniform Gifts and Uniform Transfers to Minors Acts (UGMA and UTMA) allow the establishment of an account for\\ngifts of cash and financial assets for a minor without the expense of creating a trust. Because the minor is the owner of\\nthe account, it counts as the minor9s asset on the FAFSA form, not the asset of the custodian, who is often the parent.\\nTrust funds are considered an asset of the named beneficiary of the trust, even if the beneficiary9s access to the trust is\\nrestricted. If the settlor of a trust has voluntarily placed restrictions on its use, then the beneficiary should report its\\npresent value as an asset, as discussed below. If a trust has been restricted by court order, however, the beneficiary\\nshould not report it. An example of such a restricted trust is one set up by court order to pay for future surgery for the\\nvictim of a car accident.\\nHow the trust must be reported depends on whether the beneficiary receives or will receive the interest income, the trust\\nprincipal, or both. In the case of a divorce or separation where the trust is owned jointly and ownership is not being\\ncontested, the property and the debt are equally divided between the owners for reporting purposes unless the terms of\\nthe trust specify some other method of division.\\nIf a beneficiary receives interest only from the trust, any interest received in the base year must be reported as income.\\nIf the interest accumulates and is not paid out, the recipient must report an asset value for the interest they will receive.\\nThe trust officer can usually calculate the value of the interest the person will receive while the trust exists. This value\\nrepresents the amount a third person would be willing to pay for the interest income.\\nThe person who will receive principal only from the trust must report the present value of his or her right to that\\nprincipal as an asset. For example, if a $10,000 principal reverts to a student9s parent when the trust ends in ten years\\nand the student is receiving the interest, the student would report the interest received as income and the present value\\nof the student9s parent9s rights to the principal is reported as an asset of the parent (if the student is required to report\\nparental data) on the student9s FAFSA form. The present value of the principal can be calculated by the trust officer; it9s\\nthe amount that a third person would pay for the right to receive the principal ten years from now4basically, the amount\\nthat one would have to deposit now to receive $10,000 in ten years.\\nIf a beneficiary receives both interest and principal from the trust, the beneficiary should report the present value of'),\n",

If the trust is set up so that the interest\\naccumulates within the trust until it ends, the beneficiary should report the present value of the interest and principal that\\nthey are expected to receive when the trust ends as an asset.\\nIn some cases, ownership of an asset may be divided or contested, which can affect how the owner reports the asset. If\\nthe owner has only part ownership of an asset, the owner should report only the owned part. Generally, the value of an\\nasset and debts against it should be divided equally by the number of people who share ownership unless the share of the\\nasset is determined by the amount invested or the terms of the arrangement specify some other means of division.\\nIf ownership is contested, the asset should not be reported on the FAFSA form. For instance, if a couple is separated\\nand can9t sell or borrow against jointly owned property because it9s being contested, the net worth of the property would\\nnot be reported as an asset. If ownership of an asset is resolved after the initial application is filed, the value cannot be\\nupdated. If there9s a lien against the asset, the net value of the asset is determined by subtracting any associated debt\\nand the amount of the lien from its total value. If foreclosure of an asset is imminent, the net value of the asset would still\\nbe reported until the party making the foreclosure completes legal action to take possession of the asset. If the status of\\nthe property changes after the application is filed, the value cannot be updated.\\nExcluded Assets\\nThe following are excluded assets and should not be reported on the FAFSA form:\\nPossessions such as a car for personal use, a sound system, clothes, or furniture.\\nA family9s principal place of residence, even if it is part of a business or farm property.\\nRetirement and life insurance plans and ABLE accounts.

The value of\\nretirement plans4401(k) plans, pension funds, annuities, noneducation IRAs, Keogh plans, etc.4also is not counted\\nas an asset, but distributions do count as income. An exception to reporting pension distributions is when they are\\nrolled over into another retirement plan in the same tax year (rollover). Similarly, the cash value or equity of a whole\\nlife insurance policy isn9t reported as an asset, but an insurance settlement may count as income if it is included in\\nthe student9s AGI.\\nExcluded assets for Native American students.

It varies according to\\nthe number in the parents9 family size, as reported on the FAFSA form. In general, a school can assume that 30% of\\nthe income protection allowance amount is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for transportation expenses, 16% for\\nclothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family consumption.\\nEmployment expense allowance.

The rates in Table A5 increase from 22% to 47% as the adjusted available income\\nincreases. This is based on the principle that as income increases beyond the amount needed to maintain a basic\\nstandard of living, the portion used for family maintenance decreases and the portion available for discretionary purposes\\nincreases. Therefore, a progressively larger amount of income may be contributed toward postsecondary educational\\ncosts. The parents9 contribution from adjusted available income may be negative.\\nStudent9s Contribution From Income\\nStudent9s available income.

It states\\nthat the Secretary will not enforce the verification requirements during the award year for applicants whose records were\\nlost or destroyed because of a disaster if the school has tried to preserve and reconstruct any records. The school must\\ndocument when it does not perform verification for this reason and use status code <S= when reporting the disbursement\\nof Pell Grants to affected students. Also, the requirement for dependent students to submit a statement signed by a\\nparent regarding family size is waived if the parents cannot provide the signature due to the disaster. The school must\\nnote why no parent was able to provide the statement.\\nSchools that experience a local disaster (rather than a federally declared one) that affects Title IV administration should\\nconsult their regional school participation division.\\nAcceptable Documentation\\nThe FAFSA Simplification Act requires that, wherever possible, the Department use data received directly from the IRS to\\ncalculate a student9s SAI and Pell Grant award. The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education\\nAct (FUTURE Act) requires the Department of Education to access tax information held by the IRS pertaining to FAFSA\\napplicants4and, where applicable, their parents and spouses4through a secure method: the FUTURE Act Direct Data\\nExchange (FA-DDX). The FUTURE Act amended the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to mandate the disclosure of FTI directly\\nfrom the IRS to the Department with an individual9s consent and approval. The FUTURE Act also made providing consent\\nand approval for the exchange of FTI a requirement for receiving federal student aid.\\nApplicants and contributors will be required to provide consent and approval to retrieve FTI directly from the IRS. When\\nFTI is received from the IRS via the FA-DDX, the FTI received is considered verified and no additional documentation is\\nnecessary. As a result, the FA-DDX is the fastest, easiest, and most secure method of meeting income and tax verification\\nrequirements. The September 4, 2024 Federal Register Notice gives the documentation required for verifying 2025-26\\napplication data, which depends on the item verified, as explained in this section.\\nIf you use a verification document, be sure that it is signed, that all required sections are completed, and that any\\nrelevant tax or alternative documents are attached. Copies of original documents are acceptable. An original signature on\\nan original document, an original signature on a copy of a document, and a copy of a document with an original signature\\non it are all valid signatures, unless specifically noted in this chapter. If a copy of the tax return is used, the filer (or at\\nleast one of the filers of a joint return) must sign it or the tax preparer must provide their name and SSN, EIN, or PTIN.\\nSuggested Verification Text\\nThe Department has developed suggested text that you may use to create a verification document and to verify non-tax\\nitems, such as family size. To review the suggested text for 2025-26, please see Dear Colleague Letter GEN-24-10. The\\nsuggested text fulfills verification requirements, but schools do not have to use it, except as noted below. Instead, they\\nmay develop and use their own (or someone else9s) text, forms, documents, statements, and certifications that are\\nspecific to the items required to be verified for a particular student or group of students at the school. However, schools\\nthey tried to locate their estranged spouse. The school determines that the student doesn9t need to verify their\\nspouse9s tax and income information. However, the student must still verify their own information. The school\\nmay also choose to use professional judgment to remove the spouse9s information from the student9s FAFSA form.\\nVerification Exclusions\\n34 CFR 668.54(b)'),\n",

Before requesting a\\ntranscript, they should allow enough time to pass after filing the return; it takes the IRS two to four weeks to process\\nreturns filed electronically and six to eight weeks for mailed returns. Tax transcripts submitted to your school for\\nverification do not need to be signed by the tax filer (but it is encouraged) unless you have reason to doubt their\\nauthenticity.\\nThere are a few ways to request a tax return transcript. The IRS provides instructions on all options at\\nwww.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript. Per the IRS, the fastest and easiest way is to access personal tax records online,\\nwhich allows the tax filer to get a real-time, electronic transcript. Tax filers who opt to request transcripts by mail or\\nphone will receive a mailed transcript in return. Schools can accept and copy transcripts originally obtained from the IRS.\\nThe IRS9s Income Verification Express Service (IVES) allows a third party to request and receive a tax filer9s transcript. The\\nIVES participant submits a 4506-C form, signed by the tax filer, and receives the transcript from the IRS, which charges a\\nsmall fee for the service. Schools may apply to participate in IVES. They may also use a transcript from another IVES\\nparticipant (which is not considered a third-party servicer in this case) for verification if they have no reason to doubt its\\nauthenticity. Schools may not pass on the charge for using this service to the student.\\nTo combat identity theft, the IRS masks much of the personally identifiable information on the transcript. For example,\\nonly the last four digits of any SSN or account or telephone number are displayed. When requesting a transcript,\\ntaxpayers will be prompted to create a <customer file number= which appears on a requested transcript to help facilitate\\nidentification. This can be something like a student9s college ID number or some other number (but not an SSN). See the\\nOctober 4, 2018, announcement and the IRS news release for more information.\\nEach year the Department provides a tax return transcript matrix to assist schools with reviewing tax data. Specifically,\\nthe tax return transcript matrix consists of a chart of the FAFSA and ISIR tax items used for verification and their\\ncorresponding line items from the various IRS tax returns and the tax transcript for the appropriate award year. At the\\ntime the 2025-26 Application and Verification Guide was published, the 2023 tax return transcript matrix had not been'),\n",

The student filed joint return\\nwith their spouse in 2023 but have now divorced. The AGI on the student9s FAFSA matches the AGI of $56,500 on\\nthe 2023 tax return, which means it9s wrong because it includes the student9s former spouse's income.\\nThe student9s W-2 shows that their income for 2023 was $25,900, and the tax return shows $400 in interest.\\nBecause it was interest on a joint savings account, the aid administrator adds $200 of it to the student9s income\\nand submits $26,100 as the corrected income.\\nThe aid administrator then determines that if the student had filed their tax return as single in 2023, their\\nstandard deduction would have been $13,850 (instead of $27,700 for married filers). The student9s income of\\n$26,100 minus $13,850 for the standard deduction results in $12,250 in taxable income.\\nThe aid administrator uses the 2023 tax table to determine how much tax the student would have paid on this\\namount, considering any applicable credits reported on the original return. With a taxable income of $12,250, the\\ntax amount from the tax schedule is $1,253.\\nTo use the proportional distribution method instead, the aid administrator figures out what percentage of the joint\\nAGI student9s income represents. The percentage is 46% (26,100 ÷ 56,500 is .4619). The aid administrator then\\nmultiplies the income tax paid as reported on the tax return ($3,019 for this example) by this percentage. The\\nstudent9s income tax by using this method is $1,394 (.46 x $3,019).\"),\n",

See Dear Colleague\\nLetter GEN-22-15 for additional guidance and discussion of the changes made by the FAFSA Simplification Act.\\nSpecial Circumstances\\nAn FAA may use PJ on a case-by-case basis to adjust the components of a student9s cost of attendance or the data used to\\ncalculate their SAI. This adjustment is valid only at the school making the change.\\nThe law gives some examples of special circumstances that may be considered (HEA Sec. 479A):\\nChange in employment status, income, or assets;\\nChange in housing status (e.g., homelessness);\\nTuition expenses at an elementary or secondary school;\\nAdditional family members enrolled in college;\\nMedical, dental, or nursing home expenses not covered by insurance;\\nChild or dependent care expenses;\\nSevere disability of the student or other member of the student9s household; and\\nOther changes or adjustments that impact the student9s costs or ability to pay for college.\\nThis is not an exhaustive list. You may use your discretion to make appropriate, reasonable adjustments to reflect a\\nstudent9s situation more accurately. You may also use your discretion to deny a student9s request for adjustment.\\nHowever, you may not maintain a policy to deny all requests for special circumstance adjustments.

Documentation can include a documented interview between the\\nstudent and the financial aid administrator and supplementary information, as necessary, about the student9s financial\\nstatus relating to the special circumstances for which the student is requesting an adjustment. You must resolve any\\ninconsistent or conflicting information before making any adjustments. An FAA9s decision regarding adjustments is final\\nand cannot be appealed to the Department.\\nThe law doesn9t allow you to modify either the formula or the tables used in the SAI calculation; you can only\\nchange the cost of attendance components, or the values of specific data elements used in the SAI calculation. In\\naddition, you cannot adjust data elements or the cost of attendance solely because you believe the tables and formula are\\nnot adequate or appropriate. The data elements that are adjusted must relate to the student9s special circumstances. For\\nexample, if a family member is ill, you might modify the AGI to allow for lower earnings in the coming year or might adjust\\nassets to indicate that family savings will be spent on medical expenses.\\nYou also cannot use PJ to waive general student eligibility requirements or to circumvent the intent of the law or\\nregulations. For instance, you cannot use PJ to change FSEOG selection criteria.\\nOccasionally FAAs have made decisions contrary to the professional judgment provision9s intent. These <unreasonable=\\njudgments have included, for example, the reduction of income or AGI based on recurring costs such as vacation\\nexpenses, tithing expenses, and standard living expenses (e.g. utilities, credit card expenses, children9s allowances, etc.).\\nFAAs must make <reasonable= decisions that support the intent of the law. Your school is accountable for all professional\\njudgment decisions and for fully documenting each decision.\\nWhen considering using PJ, an FAA should keep in mind that an income protection allowance (IPA) is included in the SAI\\ncalculation to account for modest living expenses. Before adjusting for an unusual expense, consider whether it is already\\ncovered by the IPA. It is reasonable to assume that approximately 30% of the IPA is for food, 22% for housing, 9% for\\ntransportation expenses, 16% for clothing and personal care, 11% for medical care, and 12% for other family\\nconsumption. The income protection allowance is one of the intermediate values in the FAA Information section of the\\noutput document (labeled as <IPA=). See Chapter 3 for the IPA values and how they impact the student9s SAI calculation.\\nIf you use professional judgment to adjust a data element, you must use the resulting SAI consistently for all Title IV aid\\nawarded to that student. For example, if for awarding the student9s Pell Grant you adjust a data element that affects the\\nSAI, that new SAI must also be used to determine the student9s eligibility for aid from the Campus-Based and Direct Loan\\nprograms.\\nIf you make a PJ adjustment, you must set the FAA Adjustment flag. You submit a PJ change electronically, via the\\nFAFSA Partner Portal or third-party software and may do so without a signature from the student or parent. In the FAFSA\\nPartner Portal or Electronic Data Exchange (EDE), you must select < yes= for the professional judgment field.

Though\\ninstitutions can ask students if their unusual circumstances or homeless situation has changed each year, they should not\\nmaintain a practice that delays or hinders financial aid for such a student, nor may they require the student to answer\\nprior to packaging or disbursing aid or require the student to submit additional documentation unless there is conflicting\\ninformation that the institution needs to resolve.\\nTo override the student9s dependent status on an initial application through the FAFSA Partner Portal, the FAA should use\\nthe Dependency Override code of <1= (see Volume 4A of the 2025-26 FAFSA Specifications Guide for more information).\\nTo authorize a dependency override on a paper FAFSA form, the FAA marks the bubble for an override, labeled <D/O,= in\\nthe <College Use Only= area, fills in the school9s federal code, and signs.

If a student had an override done at another\\nschool in the current year, that will be noted with the school9s federal code on the FAFSA Partner Portal.

The student doesn9t\\nknow how to contact them. The FAA asks the student for documentation and the student says they have a relative\\nliving in the U.S. who can confirm the situation. The FAA, per institutional policy, asks for the relative to either\\nappear in person and sign a statement confirming the student9s account or to send the aid office a notarized\\nstatement. The relative, who works not far from the school, comes to the aid office, signs the statement, and the\\nFAA grants the student a dependency override.'),\n",

For the Pell Grant program, a student is an undergraduate only if the student has not earned or completed the\\nrequirements for a bachelor9s or professional degree. A student who has earned a baccalaureate degree or a first\\nprofessional degree cannot receive a Pell Grant. However, students enrolled in an eligible post baccalaureate program as\\ndescribed below are still considered undergraduates for purposes of Pell Grant eligibility.\\nA student who completes a master9s program has earned a degree beyond the baccalaureate level, making the student\\nineligible for a Pell Grant even if they do not have a bachelor9s degree and enroll in an undergraduate program. Most\\nprofessional degrees are also considered beyond the baccalaureate level; the same restrictions apply to students who\\nhave earned professional degrees considered beyond the baccalaureate level.\\nA student who has received an associate degree4or any certificate or diploma below the baccalaureate level4and who\\nenrolls in another undergraduate program continues to be considered an undergraduate student until the student has\\ncompleted the curriculum requirements for a first bachelor9s degree.\\nA student with a baccalaureate or professional degree is ineligible even if the degree is from an unaccredited school or is\\nnot accepted for admission or transfer credit by your school. Similarly, a student with a baccalaureate or professional\\ndegree from a foreign school usually isn9t eligible for a Pell Grant. But because a foreign degree often won9t translate\\nneatly into the American classification, the school must judge whether it equates to a U.S. bachelor9s degree. If the\\nstudent provides written documentation that the foreign degree is not equivalent to a bachelor9s degree awarded in the\\nUnited States, you may determine that the student does not have a bachelor9s degree. Documents supporting such a\\nconclusion may include information about the type of school the student attended and total years of education leading to\\nthe degree.\\nA student enrolled in a program that lasts longer than five years, typically first professional degree programs such as a\\nsix-year pharmacy program, can be considered an undergraduate for only the first three or four years. Students enrolled\\nin dual-degree programs that confer a bachelor9s degree and either a graduate or first professional degree are\\nundergraduates for at least the first three years of the program. The school determines at what point after three years the\\nstudent ceases to be an undergraduate student. The student must be considered a graduate student after the fourth year\\nof such programs (see Volume 1, Chapter 1 for further discussion).\\nOccasionally, a student will complete all the requirements for a bachelor9s degree but will continue taking undergraduate\\ncourses without accepting the degree. Your school must decide whether and at what point the student completed the\\nbaccalaureate course of study. If your school determines that the student did complete a bachelor9s program (regardless\\nof whether the student accepted the degree), then the student is no longer eligible to receive a Pell Grant.\\nWrong Grade Level on the FAFSA Form\\nWhen an undergraduate student incorrectly reports on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form that\\nthe student will be a graduate student or has a bachelor9s degree, the student must correct that information.

Accordingly, a program in which\\nundergraduate students are routinely allowed to enroll would not meet the definition of a postbaccalaureate program for\\nthis purpose, nor would a program that is generally open to undergraduates but that also admits students with bachelor9s\\ndegrees. For Title IV purposes, a school must treat a student who receives a Pell Grant under this provision as enrolled in\\nan undergraduate program. Such a student is eligible for Federal Work-Study and fifth-year undergraduate (not graduate\\nstudent) Direct Loan limits but would not be eligible for a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).\\nEligible Postbaccalaureate Program and the FAFSA\\nNormally, students who indicate on the FAFSA that they have a bachelor9s degree won9t be listed in the Department9s\\nrecords as Pell-eligible students, and the school won9t be able to receive Pell funds for them. However, to allow students\\nwho are eligible under the postbaccalaureate program provision to be paid, students who correctly report that they have a\\nbachelor9s degree but also indicate on the FAFSA form that they are in a teaching credential program will be listed as Pell-\\neligible students. Of course, you must determine whether the student falls under the eligible postbaccalaureate provision.\\nProhibition on Receiving Two Pell Grant Payments for Concurrent Enrollment\\nA student may not receive Pell Grant payments concurrently from more than one school. If a student is awarded Pell for\\nany period of concurrent enrollment, the student has the choice of which award to receive but is limited to a single award\\nfrom a single school.\\nFor Pell purposes, the phrase <concurrently from more than one institution= means that the student must be attending\\nboth schools at the same time for the concurrent Pell Grant prohibition to apply. A student who withdraws from one school\\nand enrolls at least one day later in another school is normally not considered to have been enrolled concurrently. If a\\nPell-eligible student withdraws from one institution but meets one of the Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4) withdrawal\\nexemptions and subsequently enrolls at a different institution during the same payment period, the new institution can\\naward Pell Grant funds for any remaining portion of the overlapping payment period. See Chapter 6 of this volume for\\nadditional information on awarding remaining eligibility for a transfer student. The new institution should maintain\\ndocumentation in the student9s file supporting a Pell Grant disbursement at that institution following the student's\\nwithdrawal from the prior school.\\nEligible Postbaccalaureate Programs\\n34 CFR 690.6(c)\\nHEA Sec. 401(d)(4)(B)\\nProhibition on Concurrent Enrollment\"),\n",

If we use the method in Example 3, this amount must be prorated by the\\nlesser of the following two fractions:\\nCredit/clock hours in academic year definition (900) ÷ Credit/clock hours awarded (1,000)\\nOR\\nWeeks in academic year definition (26) ÷ Weeks provided (40)\\nThe lesser of the two fractions is the one based on weeks (26/40). Multiply the total program cost by this fraction\\nto determine the Pell costs for a full academic year:\\n$5,900 x (26/40) = $3,835\\nIf the student is in a category where costs are limited, such as less-than-half-time enrollment, those costs that are\\nallowable must be based on costs for a full-time student for a full academic year. For instance, the tuition\\ncomponent of the Pell COA for a less-than-half-time student must be based on the tuition costs that would be\\nincurred by a full-time student attending a full academic year.'),\n",

However, since the\\nless-than-half-time Pell Grant COA ($3,500) is less than the Pell Grant amount ($7,500), the student9s Scheduled Award as\\na less-than-half-time student is capped at $3,500. See <Volume 7, Chapter 4, Example 4= for a demonstration of how to\\ndetermine the student9s annual award, based on less-than-half-time enrollment intensity.\\nPell Grant Cost of Attendance for Cooperative Education\\nIf a student has a co-op job for the first term, the tuition and fees for that period can be prorated over the full academic\\nyear for the program (which must include at least 24 semester/trimester hours, 36 quarter credit hours, or 900 clock\\nhours, as well as 30 weeks of instructional time, or, for clock-hour programs, 26 weeks). This prorated amount is then\\nadded to the other COA components to arrive at the total cost for a full-time student for a full academic year.\\nFor the rest of the year, your school can either use the COA with the projected amount or can recalculate the student9s\\ntuition and fees at the end of the first term to determine a new COA for the remaining payment periods. This decision\\nmust be consistent with your school9s overall policy on recalculating for changes in a student9s costs. Note that the COA\\ncan also include employment-related expenses.\\nPell Grant Cost of Attendance for a Consortium Program\\nA student receiving a Pell Grant for attendance at two schools through a consortium agreement may have costs from both\\nschools at the same time. The student9s COA is calculated in the same way as for a student taking classes at only one\\nschool. The student9s charges for tuition and fees and books and supplies at the consortium schools must be combined\\ninto a single charge for a full academic year for purposes of the Pell calculation.\\nThe school paying the student may choose to use actual charges for the student, which would simply be the sum of the\\nactual charges at each school. Of course, if the student isn9t attending full-time, your school will have to prorate these\\ntuition and fees and books and supplies charges so that they are the correct amounts for a full-time, full-year student.\\nIf the disbursing school uses average charges, then the average full-time charges at each of the schools must be prorated\\nand combined. If the student is taking a full-time load at each school, the full-time tuition and fees charges for an\\nacademic year at each school can be averaged to determine the tuition and fee cost. However, if the student is taking an\\nunequal course load, the disbursing school must prorate the charges based on the number of hours the student is taking\\nat each school.'),\n",

For example, the correct\\nway to prorate a $2,150 Scheduled Award for a payment period that is a nonstandard term of 10 weeks of instructional\\ntime, for a program that has 30 weeks of instructional time is to multiply the Scheduled Award by the number of weeks of\\ninstructional time in the term, then divide by the number of weeks of instructional time in the academic year or ($2,150 x\\n10) ÷ 30 = $716.67.\\nIn this case, if you were to first divide the fraction consisting of the weeks in the payment period over the weeks in the\\nacademic year to get a decimal (10 ÷ 30 = 0.333333...) and then round the decimal either down (0.33) or up (0.34),\\nmultiplying that decimal by the Scheduled Award amount would result in a number that9s too low (0.33 x $2,150 =\\n$709.50) or too high (0.34 x $2,150 = $731.00).\\nRounding\\nThe Common Origination and Disbursement System (COD) accepts cents and whole dollar amounts in payment amounts\\nfor Pell. If your school disburses in whole dollar amounts, you may round up if the decimal is 0.50 or higher, or round down\\nif it's less than 0.50. When rounding for a student expected to be enrolled for more than one payment period in the award\\nyear, alternate rounding up and down, unless a different Pell award amount is calculated for the following term (for\\nexample, when a student9s enrollment intensity changes). In this case, the alternate rounding restarts and you may round\\nup for two consecutive terms. Your policy on rounding must be applied equally to all students.\\nAs an example, consider a student who is enrolled full time in a program offered in a traditional academic calendar\\nconsisting of fall and spring semesters. The student's full-time Scheduled Award is $7,005. Under Pell Formula 1 (as\\ndescribed later in this chapter), the student's full-time payment for each of the two terms (fall and spring) is $3,502.50.\\nUsing the rounding rule stated above, you would round the student's fall payment up to $3,503, and round the spring\\npayment down to $3,502.\\nFinally, when calculating eligibility using Pell Formula 2 or 3, you may round the annual award to the nearest whole dollar\\nbefore determining the disbursement amounts for each term. See <Volume 7, Chapter 4, Example 9= for a demonstration\\nof this rounding rule.\\nPell Formula 1: Credit-Hour Programs Using Standard Terms With At Least 30 Weeks of Instructional Time\\nTo use Pell Formula 1, the program must:\\nMeasure academic progress in credit hours;\\nBe offered in semesters, trimesters, or quarters;\\nDefine full-time enrollment for each term in the award year as at least 12 credit hours; and\\nUse an academic calendar providing at least 30 weeks of instructional time that meets either of the following sets of\\nrequirements:\\nImportant: These rounding rules do not apply if the amount disbursed would exceed the student9s Pell Grant\\neligibility for the award year or place the student9s Lifetime Eligibility Used over 600%.\"),\n",

Aside from these considerations, the decision about which award year to use is based\\non the student9s remaining eligibility in the earlier award year. This assessment is made according to your school9s\\npayment period policy, which for crossover Pell payment periods may apply to:\\nan individual student;\\nall students or a category of students without exception; or\\nall students or a category of students with allowance for exceptions in the case of individual students.\\nAlthough you may assign a crossover payment period to either of the relevant award years (subject to the limitations\\ndescribed below), you must make the assignment based on what you determine will be most beneficial to students.\\nYou may assign the Pell Grant award to a different award year than the rest of the student9s Title IV aid. You can make a\\npayment for a crossover payment period out of either award year if the student has a valid FAFSA Submission\\nSummary/ISIR for the award year selected. You may assign two consecutive crossover payment periods to the same\\naward year. For example, you could treat summer 2025 and summer 2026 as both being in the 2025-26 award year. You\\nmay also source the Pell funds from different award years for different students, as their eligibility allows, depending on\\ntheir remaining eligibility and financial need.\\nYou may not make a payment which will result in the student receiving more than their Scheduled Award for an award\\nyear, unless the student is eligible for a Year-Round Pell award (see Year-Round Pell Grant section later in this chapter), in\\nwhich case the student may be eligible to receive up to 150% of their Scheduled Award for the award year.\\nTerm Schools: Using the Formula for Summer Sessions\\nIf your school offers a summer term in addition to fall through spring terms that qualify for Formula 1 or 2, you will\\ncalculate the student9s payment for the summer term using the same formula that you used to calculate payments for the\\nother terms in the award year to which the summer term is assigned. If you use Formula 3 for Pell Grant calculations in\\nany of the terms in an award year, then you must use Formula 3 for all terms in that program occurring in that award\\nyear, including the fall through spring terms. (Note that if your program is a standard-term program in the fall through\\nspring and does not define full-time enrollment in the summer as at least 12 credit-hours, you must use Formula 3 for Pell\\ncalculations for all terms in the award year.) Your school must apply its definition of full-time status for the\\nsummer term consistently for all Title IV program purposes.\\nCrossover Payment Periods\\n34 CFR 690.64\\nDear Colleague Letter GEN-17-06'),\n",

If your school has fall and\\nspring semesters that comprise an academic year, you can9t add the costs for the summer term to the costs for the fall\\nand spring semesters. The award for the summer term is still based on the costs for one academic year. However, if the\\nacademic year definition includes the summer term, then the costs for the summer term must be included in the cost for\\na full academic year.\\nIf the student was previously enrolled in the award year, you may be able to use the same Pell Grant COA for the summer\\nterm that you used for the immediately preceding term that the student attended. However, this isn9t possible if the costs\\nare different from the fall through spring, such as a different tuition charge per credit hour, or if you are required to\\nrecalculate the Pell Grant COA. If it9s necessary to base the student9s Pell Grant COA on the summer term, you must\\nprorate the summer costs to the length of an academic year to establish the cost for a full academic year. See Chapter 3\\nof this volume for additional information on prorating costs in the Pell Grant program.\\nIf the summer session is the first term in the award year for that student (for example, your school is paying a student for\\nthe summer 2025 term from the 2025-26 award year), you must establish the student9s full-year cost based on the costs\\nfor the summer term. If the student enrolls in another term in that award year, you may have to recalculate the student9s\\ncosts for the later term.\\nReceiving Less Than the Scheduled Award Due to Crossover\\nA student may also receive less than a Scheduled Award in an award year if the student9s program crosses award years\\nand the student9s Pell Grant award in one of the award years is for a portion of the program that is less than a full\\nacademic year. For example, if a student9s last term of enrollment to complete their academic program is summer 2025,\\nand the school treats the payment period as a header to the 2025-26 academic year, the student may receive a Pell Grant\\ndisbursement for that one payment period, which will be less than the student9s full Scheduled Award for 2025-26.\\nCrossover Pell and Withdrawal\\nFor details on how to perform Return of Title IV Funds calculations in a crossover Pell situation, see Volume 5, Chapter 2 of\\nthe FSA Handbook.\\nSummer Modules\\nIf a term-based school offers a series of modules that overlap two award years, these modules may be combined and\\ntreated as one term. Schools are not required to combine modules. However, if you do not combine the modules to create\\na single term and the modules overlap, the program must be considered a non-term program.\\nWhen you combine modules into a single term (i.e., payment period), the weeks of instructional time in the combined\\nterm are the weeks of instructional time from the beginning of the first module to the date the last module ends.

In addition to fall and spring semesters, the school offers three summer modules. Each module\\nprovides four weeks of instructional time (as defined in Volume 3, Chapter 1). The school can either combine the\\nmodules into a single standard term or treat each module as a separate nonstandard term. The school chooses to\\ncombine the modules into a single term providing 12 weeks of instructional time with full-time enrollment defined\\nas 12 semester hours. If the school meets the conditions for use of Formula 1 in its fall and spring semesters, it\\ncan use Formula 1 to calculate Pell Grant payments for this summer session.\\nThe student enrolls for three semester hours in each of the modules (nine hours total in the combined term) which\\nis 75% enrollment intensity. The student9s Scheduled Award is $7,500 and their annual award is $5,625 ($7,500 x\\n75%). To calculate the student9s payment, the school simply divides the annual award by two, the number of\\nterms in the fall through spring: $5,625/2 = $2,812.50.

This percentage is calculated by dividing the\\namount disbursed at the previous school by the student9s Scheduled Award at that school (COD calculates this and you\\ncan refer to COD to see what the percentage of remaining eligibility will be for a student).\\nPell disbursed at prior school ÷ Scheduled Award at prior school = % of Scheduled Award used\\nThen subtract this percentage from 100% (or 150%, if the student is enrolled and eligible for a Year-Round award). The\\nresult is the maximum percentage of the Scheduled Award that the student may receive at your school. Note that a\\ntransfer student receives the same payments as any other student until the limit (up to 150% of a Scheduled Award; see\\nthe Year-Round Pell Grant section in Chapter 5 of this volume) is reached. Give the student the full amount for each\\npayment period, rather than trying to ration the remaining amount by splitting it evenly across the\\nremaining terms.\\nA transfer student must repay any amount received in an award year that exceeds their Scheduled Award (or 150% of\\ntheir Scheduled Award, if enrolled and eligible for Year-Round Pell), unless the school that disbursed the award was at\\nfault by failing to follow the administrative requirements in 34 CFR 668.\\nWhy Percentages Are Used\\nA student may have different Scheduled Awards at different schools/programs. Using percentages ensures that a student\\ndoes not receive more than 100% (or 150%, if enrolled and eligible for Year-Round Pell) of the student9s Scheduled Award.\\nFor example, the COAs at the two schools may be different or one school may modify data elements on the FAFSA form\\ndue to professional judgment where another school did not. The percentages are also used to compare the portions of a\\nstudent9s total eligibility that have been used at both schools. If the student9s Scheduled Award is the same at both\\nschools, the financial aid administrator can find the amount of the student9s remaining eligibility simply by subtracting the\\namount received at the first school from the Scheduled Award.\\nPayment Period for a Transfer Student at a Non-Term School\\nWhen a student transfers into a non-term credit-hour or clock-hour program at a new school, that student is starting a\\nnew payment period. For non-term programs, you must use the payment period rules described in/Volume 3, Chapter 1/to\\ndetermine the payment periods for the remainder of the student9s program.\\nHowever, for a transfer student, the length of the program is the number of clock or credit-hours and the number of weeks\\nof instructional time that the student will be required to complete in the new program. If the remaining clock or credit\\nhours/or weeks of instructional time/are half an academic year or less, then the remaining hours and weeks of instructional\\ntime constitute one payment period.\\nTransfer Students and Remaining Eligibility\\nConsider a student who is eligible for Pell Grant funds and who transfers from School A to School B within the same award\\nyear. Before paying any Pell funds to the student, School B must determine the percentage of eligibility remaining for the\\nstudent.

There are several ways for you to get a student9s financial aid history from\\nNSLDS.

Schools should examine the Pell\\npayment data on the ISIR generated from the student9s most recent transaction to see if the percentage of the Scheduled\\nAward used for the award year is greater than 0. If the ISIR is the most recent and the percentage of the Scheduled Award\\nused for the award year is greater than zero, the school should request transfer monitoring of that student and wait until\\nit has received the results of that process through NSLDS before creating a Pell award for that student in the COD System.\\nConcurrent Enrollment and Pell Potential Overaward\\nWhen multiple schools report disbursements for a student and the enrollment dates reported are within 30 calendar days\\nof each other, the COD System identifies a potential concurrent enrollment and sends a warning message to all schools\\ninvolved. The COD System sends the school that submitted the second or subsequent disbursement information a\\nresponse document that contains warning edit 69. Warning edit 69 informs schools that submit second or subsequent\\ndisbursement information that Pell disbursements for a student have been received from two or more schools and the\\nenrollment dates for the student are within 30 days of one another. The COD System also sends a multiple reporting\\nrecord (MRR) to all the schools with accepted disbursement information in the COD system for the student and the award\\nyear. The MRR alerts the schools to a possible overlap in enrollment. The Department expects all schools involved to\\ncooperate in resolving the concurrent enrollment issue. To help facilitate resolution, the MRR contains the Pell contact\\nmuch as $1,687.50 if the student remains enrolled at School Y for the balance of the award year.\\nDuring the first payment period, the student receives $1,500 in Pell funds:\\n(300 hours in payment period x $4,500) ÷ 900 hours in academic year = $1,500\\nHowever, in the second payment period, the student can only receive funds until their total Pell at School Y\\nreaches $1,687.50 (and the student9s total for the award year reaches 150% their Scheduled Award amount of\\n$4,500). Therefore, for the second payment period at School Y, the student can only receive $187.50 ($1,687.50 3\\n$1,500 = $187.50).\\nNote that if the student received a Direct Loan at School X and now wishes to borrow a Direct Loan at School Y,\\nthe method for determining the remaining eligibility for Direct Loan funds in transfer student situations is very\\ndifferent from the method of determining remaining Pell Grant eligibility.

If the student withdraws from all classes (or doesn9t begin\\nattending any classes), you must follow the procedures discussed in Volume 5.\\nPell Recalculation Due to Change in COA\\nWhen a student9s COA changes during the award year, and their enrollment intensity remains the same, you may (but are\\nnot required to) establish a policy under which you recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award. Once established, you must\\nconsistently apply such a recalculation policy to all students in the program.\\nTuition and Fee Charges and Recalculation\\nIf your school recalculates a student9s Pell Grant due to a change in enrollment intensity but continues to charge tuition\\nand fees for credit hours that are no longer included in the student9s enrollment intensity for Pell Grant purposes, this\\ndoes not affect the requirement to recalculate the student9s Pell Grant award.\\nFor example, if a student enrolls as a full-time student with 12 credits, but never starts attendance in a 3-credit class that\\nstarts after the school9s <add/drop= date, the student9s award must be recalculated based on 9 credits or 75% enrollment\\nintensity. This is true, even though the school charges tuition for any classes dropped after the <add/ drop= date, and\\ntherefore continues to charge the student for 12 credits.\\nRecalculation of Pell Grant Awards for Students Who Graduate Early From a Clock-Hour Program\\nUnder the regulations that govern the treatment of Title IV funds when a student withdraws, a student who completes all\\nthe requirements for graduation from a program before completing the days or hours they were scheduled to complete is\\nnot considered to have withdrawn, and no return of Title IV funds calculation is required (see Volume 5 for more detail).\\nHowever, a school may be required to return a portion of the Pell Grant funds that were awarded to a student who\\nsuccessfully completes the requirements for graduation from a clock-hour program before completing the number of clock\\nhours that they were scheduled to complete. Note that successfully completed clock hours may include a limited number\\nof clock hours for which the student was granted an excused absence if your school has an excused absence policy that\\nmeets the requirements described in 34 CFR 668.4(e). For more information, see the discussion of \"Excused absences in\\nclock-hour programs\" in Volume 3, Chapter 1.\\nA student\\'s eligibility to receive Title IV aid for a clock-hour program is based, in part, on the total number of clock hours\\nin the program. If a school allows a student to graduate from a clock-hour program without completing all the originally\\nestablished hours for the program, the school has effectively shortened the program length and reduced a student\\'s Title\\nIV aid eligibility for the program. In this circumstance, the school must recalculate the student\\'s Pell Grant award based on\\nthe number of hours the student completed. The school must return to the Department the difference between the\\nrecalculated award amount and the Pell Grant amount that the student originally received. (For a student who received a\\nDirect Loan, the school must also prorate the student\\'s annual loan limit in this situation, or, if the loan limit was originally\\nsubject to proration, recalculate the original prorated loan limit. See Volume 8 for more information.)\\nVolume 7, Chapter 7, Example 5: Pell Recalculation for Early Graduation From a Clock-Hour Program\\nConsider a student who enrolls in a 900 clock-hour program, with the academic year defined as 900 clock hours\\nand 26 weeks of instructional time. The school assumes that the student will complete 900 clock hours, and the\\nstudent9s Scheduled Award is $7,500, paid in disbursements of $3,750 in each payment period (see Chapter 1 of\\nVolume 3 for guidance on determining payment periods).\\nThe school considers the student to have met the requirements for graduation from the program after the student\\nhas completed only 750 of the originally scheduled 900 clock hours. As soon as practicable after determining that\\nthe student will meet the graduation requirements, the school must recalculate the student\\'s Pell Grant award as\\nif the student had been enrolled in a 750 clock-hour program. Although the school will recalculate the student\\'s\\naward using Formula 4 (as described in Chapter 4), in this circumstance only the number of clock hours in the\\npayment periods are considered. There is no comparison of hours and weeks fractions, as is normally required\\nwith Formula 4.\\nThe school determines the recalculated award amount for each payment period by multiplying the student\\'s'),\n",

An overaward\\nonly becomes an overpayment if a school cannot correct the overaward before all funds are disbursed to the student.\\nA correctly determined Pell Grant, based on eligibility criteria described in Chapter 2, is never adjusted to account for\\nother forms of aid. Therefore, if a student9s aid package exceeds his or her need, you must attempt to eliminate the\\noveraward by reducing other Title IV aid or other aid your school controls. You may not reduce a student9s correctly\\nawarded and disbursed Pell Grant to address overpayments in other programs.\\nIf a student received more Pell Grant funds than they were eligible for because their eligibility for the grant decreased,\\nyou can try to eliminate the overpayment by adjusting later disbursements for the award year. Additionally, a Pell Grant\\nawarded to an ineligible student or based on an incorrect enrollment intensity greater than that for which the student is\\nenrolled is an overaward. See Volume 4, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on resolving overawards.\\nPell Grant Overawards\\nA Pell Grant overaward can be caused by a school making an error in determining Pell Grant eligibility. For example, the\\nschool may use the wrong SAI or fail to limit the award by the student9s COA. A Pell Grant overaward can also result if the\\nstudent enters incorrect data on the FAFSA form and the SAI derived from the incorrect data is lower than it should be (for\\nmore detail about the FAFSA form and SAI data, see the Application and Verification Guide). A Pell overaward also exists if\\na student scheduled to receive a Pell Grant fails to begin classes or is otherwise determined to be ineligible for Title IV\\nFunds (for example, having exceeded the Pell LEU). Finally, an overaward exists whenever a student is scheduled to\\nreceive or is receiving a Pell Grant for attendance at two or more schools concurrently. All these Pell Grant overawards\\nmust be corrected.\\nThis is not an exclusive list of all the ways in which a Pell Grant may be overawarded. In addition to avoiding these\\nmistakes, schools should also be sure to submit timely Pell actual disbursement records to COD, according to the Annual\\nDeadline Date Notice as published in the Knowledge Center.\\n$7,500 Pell Grant award by 375 (the number of clock hours in each payment period based on the total of 750\\nhours that the student completed), then dividing the result by 900 (the number of clock hours in the program's\\nacademic year). This results in two recalculated disbursements of $3,125 each, for a total award of $6,250. The\\nschool reduces the original first and second disbursements by $625, then returns the total difference of $1,250 to\\nthe Department. Note that the school 3 not the student 3 is responsible for returning the excess Pell Grant funds in\\nthis situation.\\nNote: It is possible for a correctly awarded Pell Grant to exceed the student9s financial need. For example, a\\nstudent9s SAI may exceed their COA, but the student may still qualify for a Minimum Pell Grant, based on that set\\nof eligibility criteria. Further, a student may be eligible for a Max Pell Grant under the Special Rule regardless of\\ntheir SAI. In these situations, the correctly determined Pell Grant is not considered an overaward, but the student\\nis not eligible for any other need-based Title IV aid. See Volume 3, Chapter 3 for additional packaging guidance.\\nLiability For and Recovery of Pell Grant Overpayments\"),\n",

These students also have a higher combined\\nsubsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit.\\nThe combined subsidized and unsubsidized aggregate loan limit for graduate and professional health professions students\\nwho are eligible to receive the increased annual unsubsidized amounts is $224,000. Not more than $65,500 of this\\namount may be from subsidized loans (see the notes following Table 4 above regarding the $65,500 subsidized aggregate\\nloan limit for graduate and professional students).\\nIf a student who received increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts for a qualifying health profession program later\\nenrolls in a non-health professions program, the student is no longer eligible for the increased Direct Unsubsidized Loan\\nlimits. However, the additional loan amounts received for the health professions program are not counted toward the\\nnormal aggregate loan limit for that student.\\nChecking Remaining Eligibility Under the Aggregate Loan Limits\\nBefore originating a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, it9s important to make sure the student still has\\nremaining eligibility under the aggregate loan limits. As long as there is no conflicting information, you may rely on the\\nfinancial aid history (provided on the ISIR as well as on the NSLDS Professional Access website) and the Transfer Student\\nMonitoring process (for transfer students only) to tell you if a student is about to exceed the applicable aggregate loan\\nlimit. (See Volume 1, Chapter 3 for more detail on NSLDS financial aid history, which may also affect eligibility for other\\nTitle IV programs.)\\nThe Loan History in NSLDS for a borrower who has received Title IV loans shows Aggregate Loan Information for the\\nborrower9s outstanding subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding\\nPrincipal Balance amounts shown for a borrower in NSLDS do not include unpaid accrued interest, capitalized interest\\n(unpaid interest that has been added to the principal balance of the loan), or other charges, as these amounts are not\\ncounted against the aggregate loan limits.\\nFor each individual loan that a borrower has received, NSLDS shows both the Outstanding Principal Balance (OPB) and the\\nAggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (Agg. OPB). The OPB is what the borrower owes, which may include capitalized\\ninterest and other charges. The Agg. OPB is the portion of the OPB that counts against the aggregate loan limits for\\nsubsidized and unsubsidized loans.\\nFor instance, suppose a student has a Direct Unsubsidized Loan disbursed in the amount of $5,000. Over time, $200 in\\ninterest accrues and is capitalized. Assuming that the borrower has made no payments on the loan, the OPB on the loan\\nwill be $5,200 (this is the amount the borrower owes), and the Agg. OPB will be $5,000 (this is the amount that is counted\\nagainst the aggregate loan limit). If you are looking at information in NSLDS for individual loans, it is the Agg. OPB that\\nyou should use to determine the student9s remaining loan eligibility under the applicable aggregate loan limit.\\nThe Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance amounts displayed in NSLDS for a borrower')],\n",

We appreciate your interest in understanding how these financial options can help support your educational journey.\\n\\nStudent loans are designed to provide financial assistance to students who may not have sufficient resources to cover the costs of college tuition and related expenses. For low-income students, these loans can be a vital tool in accessing higher education. Here are some key points to consider:\\n\\n1. **Access to Education**: Student loans can open doors to educational opportunities that might otherwise be inaccessible due to financial constraints. They allow students from low-income backgrounds to pursue degrees that can lead to better job prospects and increased earning potential.\\n\\n2. **Types of Loans**: There are various types of student loans available, including federal loans which often come with lower interest rates and more flexible repayment options. Low-income students may also be eligible for subsidized loans, where the government covers interest during school and deferment periods.\\n\\n3. **Loan Repayment**: Understanding repayment options is crucial. Federal student loans offer a range of repayment plans, including income-driven repayment plans that adjust monthly payments based on income and family size. This can be especially beneficial for low-income graduates who may be entering the workforce in lower-paying jobs while they build their careers.\\n\\n4. **Grants and Scholarships**: In addition to loans, we encourage students to explore grants and scholarships, which do not require repayment. Many organizations offer financial aid specifically geared toward low-income students.\\n\\n5. **Financial Counseling**: Seeking financial counseling can be invaluable. Many institutions provide workshops or one-on-one sessions that can help students understand their options for financing education, budgeting, and managing debt.\\n\\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance in navigating your options, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to help you succeed and make informed decisions about your education financing.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n[Your Name]  \\n[Your Position]  \\n[Company Name]  \\n[Contact Information]  \\n[Company Website]\\n\\n--- \\n\\nFeel free to modify any sections as needed before sending this response.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='NoteTaker')]}}\n",

We understand that financing education can be a significant challenge, and we are here to assist you in navigating this process.  \\n\\nIn 2024, the federal student loan system continues to support low-income students through various programs aimed at making higher education more accessible. Here are some key points to consider:  \\n\\n1. **Loan Amounts**:  \\n   - Dependent undergraduates may borrow up to $5,500 in their first year, with this amount increasing in subsequent years.   \\n   - Independent undergraduates, or dependent students whose parents are ineligible for PLUS Loans, can borrow more, starting at $9,500 in their first year.  \\n\\n2. **Income-Driven Repayment Plans**:  \\n   - For those struggling to make payments, income-driven repayment plans are available that cap monthly payments at a small percentage of your income. This ensures that loan repayment is manageable, especially for those with low incomes.  \\n\\n3. **Forgiveness Options**:  \\n   - Under recent updates, borrowers making qualifying payments under income-driven repayment plans may be eligible for loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years. Additionally, changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program may provide further relief for eligible borrowers.  \\n\\n4. **Additional Support Programs**:  \\n   - Initiatives like the Texas Advance Commitment offer tailored support to low-income students, providing additional funds to help cover housing costs and further reducing financial strain. The recent changes in the FAFSA process are also designed to increase eligibility for Pell Grants, with approximately 610,000 more low-income students now able to benefit from this support.  \\n\\n5. **Fixed Interest Rates**:  \\n   - Importantly, all federal student loans have fixed interest rates, ensuring consistency in repayment and making financial planning easier.  \\n\\nWe recommend that you visit the official federal student aid website (studentaid.gov) for comprehensive guidance tailored to your specific situation and to explore additional scholarship and grant opportunities that may be available to you.  \\n\\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with your application process, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

        "Student loans are instrumental in granting low-income students access to higher education, especially when scholarships and grants may fall short of covering the full cost of attendance. The federal student loan program presents various options designed to make borrowing more manageable for those in need.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Understanding Loan Types:**\n",
        "   - **Subsidized Loans**: These loans are available to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The government covers the interest while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, which can significantly alleviate the overall debt burden upon graduation.\n",
        "   - **Unsubsidized Loans**: Accessible to both undergraduate and graduate students, these loans do not require a demonstration of financial need. However, interest starts accruing from the moment the loan is disbursed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Income-Based Repayment Options:**\n",
        "For low-income borrowers, Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plans can be especially advantageous. These plans ensure that monthly payments are based on income and family size, which helps keep payments manageable. Additionally, after 20-25 years of qualifying payments, any remaining loan balance may be eligible for forgiveness. \n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Key Benefits:**\n",
        "   - **Lower Payments**: IBR plans decrease the monthly payment amount, making it easier for low-income students to manage their loans successfully.\n",
        "   - **Forgiveness Opportunities**: Those who pursue careers in public service may qualify for further loan forgiveness options.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. The Importance of Financial Aid Awareness:**\n",
        "It is vital for low-income students to be aware of their options concerning financial aid and student loans. We recommend that students and families familiarize themselves with the array of resources available, such as [Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov), which provides comprehensive information on eligibility and application processes.\n",
